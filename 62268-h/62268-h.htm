I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN THE CITY.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">FEAR</span> City people are very
mercenary in their views and habits.&nbsp; It is natural that
they should be so; they come into the City to make money, and
that is all they are thinking of while they are there.&nbsp; They
do not all succeed in their attempt, I know.&nbsp; Some are idle
and improvident, and do not deserve to win in the battle of
life.&nbsp; They are failures from their birth, and go mooning
about like the immortal Micawber, expecting something to turn up,
till death comes and puts an end to their expectations.&nbsp;
Some men are unlucky, and lose by every adventure; others are
born lucky, and, from no merit of their own, everything they
touch turns to gold.&nbsp; The other day a poor costermonger was
run-over in the street and killed, and it was found that he was
worth several hundreds of pounds.&nbsp; It would be interesting
to know how a costermonger could have made all that money by the
sale of apples, oranges, and greens.&nbsp; A few weeks since I
heard a distinguished judge tell an audience, consisting of
school-boys, that in his own person he was an illustration of the
fact that, in this happy England, any one, however destitute of
rank and wealth and connections he might be, would rise to the
position to which his worth entitled him; and he ended with the
recommendation of the wise man of old, &ldquo;In all thy ways
acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only
a month since I heard of the death of a Jew, who had commenced
with selling <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>pencils in the street, and had died worth a million of
money.&nbsp; How was it done?&nbsp; Ah! that&rsquo;s the
question.&nbsp; It is not done, as a rule, by the speculators;
nor is it done by the rogues who forget that honesty is the best
policy.&nbsp; Many of the men who have succeeded, it has been
remarked, have generally achieved success by the application of
some very simple principle which they have established as the
general rule of their proceedings.</p>
<p>Ricardo said that he had made his money by observing that, in
general, people greatly exaggerated the importance of
events.&nbsp; If, therefore, dealing, as he dealt, in stocks,
there was reason for a small advance, he bought, because he was
certain that an unreasonable advance would enable him to realise;
and when stocks were falling he sold, in the conviction that
alarm and panic would produce a decline not warranted by
circumstances.</p>
<p>Let us take another case&mdash;that of Rothschild, the third
son of the Frankfort banker, who came to England with
&pound;2,000, which he soon turned into &pound;60.000.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My success,&rdquo; he said to Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton,
&ldquo;all turned on one maxim: I said, I can do what another man
can.&nbsp; Another advantage I had, I was an off-hand man.&nbsp;
I made a bargain at once.&nbsp; When I was settled in London, the
East India Company had &pound;800,000 worth of gold to
sell.&nbsp; I went to the sale and bought it all.&nbsp; I knew
the Duke of Wellington must have it.&nbsp; I had bought a great
many of his bills at a discount.&nbsp; The government sent for
me, and said they must have it.&nbsp; When they had got it, they
did not know how to get it to Portugal.&nbsp; I undertook all
that, and I sent it through France; and that was the best
business I ever did.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another rule of his was never
to have anything to do with unlucky men.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
seen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;many clever men&mdash;very clever
men&mdash;who had not shoes to their feet.&nbsp; I never act with
them.&nbsp; Their advice sounds very well, but fate is against
them; they cannot get on themselves; and if they cannot do good
to themselves, how can they do good to me?&rdquo;&nbsp; His
advice to Sir Thomas&rsquo;s son was sound: &ldquo;Stick to your
business, young man; stick to your brewery, and you may be the
great brewer of London.&nbsp; Be a brewer and a banker, and a
merchant and a manufacturer, and you will soon be in the
<i>Gazette</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; How true this is, any one who has
the slightest acquaintance with City life can at once
understand.&nbsp; The <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>advice should be printed in gold in
every counting-house in London.&nbsp; If it were, and were acted
on as well, we should hear of fewer commercial failures.</p>
<p>Let me give another anecdote of the Rothschilds.&nbsp; It is
related of Baron Nathan de Meyer, that on one occasion he gave a
lady the following pithy piece of advice.&nbsp; Seated at the
dinner-table, she informed him she had an only son, whom she was
anxious to see placed well in business, and begged him to give
her a hint on the subject.&nbsp; For a long time the baron
hesitated; and at length, when urged by the lady, half
good-naturedly and half worried, he turned round and
said&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Well</i>, <i>madam</i>, <i>I will tell
you</i>.&nbsp; <i>Selling lucifer-matches is a very good business
if you have plenty of it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;Autobiographical Recollections,&rdquo; Sir John
Bowring thus speaks of the celebrated Morrison, the founder of
the great commercial house in Fore Street:&mdash;&ldquo;Morrison
told me that he owed all his prosperity to the discovery that the
great art of mercantile traffic was to find out sellers, rather
than buyers; that if you bought cheap and satisfied yourself with
only a fair profit, buyers&mdash;the best sort of buyers, those
who have money to buy&mdash;would come of themselves.&nbsp; He
said he found houses engaged, with a most expensive machinery,
sending travellers about in all directions to seek orders and to
effect sales; while he employed travellers to buy instead of to
sell; and if they bought well, there was no fear of his effecting
advantageous sales.&nbsp; So, uniting this theory with another,
that small profits and quick returns are more profitable in the
long run than long credits with great gains, he established one
of the largest and most lucrative concerns that has ever existed
in London, and was entitled to a name which I have often heard
applied to him, &lsquo;the Napoleon of
Shopkeepers.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. James Morrison, the founder
of the Fore Street warehouse, certainly deserves further
record.&nbsp; He was a native of Hants, and born of Scotch
parents.&nbsp; Early transplanted to the metropolis at the end of
the last century, the country youth first set foot in London,
unaided in search of fortune.&nbsp; His first employment was a
very menial one in a warehouse, and procured him a bare
maintenance; but his industry and trustworthiness soon secured
him a partnership in the Fore Street business of the late Mr.
Todd, whose daughter he married.&nbsp; So far it may be said that
his rise was accidental; but his constant rise <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>was no
accident.&nbsp; His enormous wealth was the result of his own
natural sagacity, perseverance, and integrity.&nbsp; During the
long course of his devotion to trade and commerce, Mr.
Morrison&rsquo;s mind never stood still.&nbsp; Every social
change in business, in demand and supply, he keenly discerned,
and promptly acted on.&nbsp; Thus his great business at once
became the first of its class.&nbsp; After the close of the great
continental wars, and the consequent rapid increase of population
and wealth, Mr. Morrison was one of the first English traders who
reversed his system of management by an entire departure from the
old exaction of the highest prices.&nbsp; His new principle was
the substitution of the lowest remunerative scale of profit, and
more rapid circulation of capital, and the success of the
experiment speedily created his wholesale trade
pre-eminence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Small profits and quick returns&rdquo;
was his motto, and other houses quickly followed in his wake; but
the genius which originated the movement, notwithstanding active
competition, maintained its supremacy.&nbsp; The result was,
that, in middle age, Mr. Morrison found himself in possession of
an enormous fortune.&nbsp; At the time of his death, his English
property was said to be of the value of three or four millions;
and, besides, he was possessed of large investments in the United
States.&nbsp; He was a lover of art, an advanced politician and
M.P., and, to the last almost, a man of study and thought.</p>
<p>In our own day, as much as in earlier times, the same rule
applies to City life.&nbsp; The linendrapers, it seems to me,
are, as a rule, the most successful.&nbsp; Since fig-leaves went
out of fashion, the ladies&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;have
always supported the linendrapers and the silk-mercers.&nbsp; The
founder of the great house of Shoolbred &amp; Co., in
Tottenham-court Road, was originally educated at the Orphan
Working School&mdash;then in the City Road, but now at Haverstock
Hill.&nbsp; The will of the late Mr. Tarn, whose shop was near
the Elephant and Castle, was proved a little while since under a
million.&nbsp; He was only about sixty years old when he died,
and commenced business some thirty years ago in a little shop,
being his own shopman.&nbsp; Mr. Meeking, whose premises in
Holborn are a series of palaces, rose, I am told, from very small
beginnings.&nbsp; A writer in a newspaper says&mdash;&ldquo;Not
long ago I was at a meeting where there were six men, of whom the
poorest, who could scarcely write, was worth <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&pound;100,000; and the richest, who never read a book
of information through in his life, was making &pound;50,000
a-year.&nbsp; They had all begun as working-men except one, who
is an M.P., and he had commenced life as a shopman, and had made
&pound;10,000 a-year.&nbsp; Such are the chances for money-makers
in England, where credit is easy.&nbsp; But then money-making is
an art&mdash;like poetry, a born gift.&rdquo;&nbsp; So says the
writer: I differ from him.&nbsp; A tradesman who lives within his
income, and who sells that for which there is a yearly increasing
demand, such as beef or shoes, or butter and cheese, however
stupid he may be, however dense his ignorance, cannot but
prosper.&nbsp; He has only to shut his eyes and open his mouth,
and take what Heaven will send him.&nbsp; With trade ability,
good health, and frugality, a man cannot help making a
fortune.&nbsp; People fail because they want to have their cake
and eat it at the same time; because they like to discount their
good fortune; because they prefer to enjoy from day to day rather
than to accumulate capital; and, lastly, because when they have
money, in their eagerness to make more, they go into some rotten
company and lose all.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I was at a grand party at the house of a
West-end swell and M.P.&nbsp; As I left I said to a friend,
&ldquo;How did Mr. &mdash; make his money?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;by borrowing ten
shillings.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the strength of that <i>recipe</i> the
writer of this article borrowed twenty; but, alas! the experiment
in his case did not answer.</p>
<p>But to return to money-making men.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Fludyers
had begun their career,&rdquo; wrote Sir Samuel Romilly,
&ldquo;in very narrow circumstances; but by extraordinary
activity, enterprise, and good fortune, they had acquired
inordinate wealth, and were every day increasing it by the
profits of a most extensive commerce.&nbsp; Sir Samuel was an
alderman of the City of London, and a member of parliament.&nbsp;
He had been created a baronet, and had served the office of Lord
Mayor, in a year very memorable in the history of City honours,
for it was that in which the king, upon his marriage, made a
visit to the corporation and dined in Guildhall.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding, however, the great elevation at which fortune
had placed these opulent relatives beyond my father, they always
maintained a very friendly intercourse with him, and professed,
perhaps sincerely, a great desire to serve him.&nbsp; Sir <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Samuel, too,
was my godfather.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died of apoplexy, and Sir
Thomas did not long survive him.</p>
<p>But instances of money-making men in the City are as plentiful
as blackberries, and I merely refer to a few of them.&nbsp; We
all have heard of Sir Peter Laurie, who had such a wonderful way
of putting down suicide, and other evils.&nbsp; He came to London
in early life, and worked, it is said, as a journeyman saddler at
a house in the neighbourhood of Charing-cross, with the late Sir
Richard Birnie.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Thomas Tegg, who, at one time, was one of the
largest booksellers in the kingdom, acquired his fortune solely
through the force and energy of his character as a man of
business.&nbsp; When he first came to London, he called on Mr.
Newman, a bookseller in Leadenhall Street, to ask for
employment.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can you do, young man?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anything you please, sir; I shall be willing to make
myself generally useful.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said
Mr. Newman, &ldquo;go and see if you can tie up that
parcel,&rdquo; pointing to a quantity of books, in a loose state,
which were lying on the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mr.
Tegg at a public meeting, &ldquo;was the first employment I was
ever engaged in as a bookseller.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus he made
his money.</p>
<p>Sir John Pirie, who, in 1841, was elected Lord Mayor, on
returning thanks in the Guildhall for the honour done him,
said&mdash;&ldquo;I little thought, forty years ago, when I came
to the City of London a poor lad from the banks of the Tweed,
that I should ever arrive at such a distinction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gentlemen learned in the law are occasionally money-making
men.&nbsp; One of these was John Campden Neild, M.A.,
barrister-at-law.&nbsp; He was the son of a wealthy gold and
silversmith in St. James&rsquo;s Street, and who bequeathed a
large property to his miserly son, which he, in turn,
considerably enlarged, and bequeathed to her Majesty.&nbsp; It
appeared that, since his father&rsquo;s death in 1814, he had
allowed his money to accumulate, and had scarcely allowed himself
the common necessaries of life.&nbsp; He usually dressed in a
blue coat with metal buttons, which he prohibited being brushed,
as it would take off the nap and deteriorate its value.&nbsp; He
was never known to wear a great-coat; he was always happy to
receive an invitation from his tenantry in Kent and Berks to
visit them, which he occasionally did, often remaining a month at
a time, as he was thus enabled to add to his savings.&nbsp; <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>His
appearance and manners led people to imagine that he was in the
lowest state of poverty.&nbsp; Just before the introduction of
the railway system of travelling, he had been on a visit to some
of his estates, and was returning to London, when the coach
stopped at Farningham.&nbsp; With the exception of our miser, the
passengers all entered the inn.&nbsp; Missing their companion,
and recollecting his decayed appearance, they conceived he was in
distressed circumstances, and, accordingly, a sum was subscribed
for the purchase of a thumping glass of brandy and water for the
benefit of the poor gentleman, which he thankfully
accepted.&nbsp; Many instances of a similar character may be
related.</p>
<p>Alderman Harmer was the son of a Spitalfields weaver, and was
left to work his way as an orphan at the age of ten.&nbsp;
Alderman Wire was the son of a baker at Colchester.&nbsp;
Alderman Kelly, who died in his 80th year, was the architect of
his own fortune.&nbsp; He was originally an assistant in the
employ of Mr. John Cooke, of Paternoster Row.&nbsp; The business
chiefly consisted in publishing works in numbers, which were sold
up and down the country by means of book-hawkers.&nbsp; Mr. Kelly
succeeded to this business, and so won fame and fortune.&nbsp; In
1836 he was Lord Mayor of London.&nbsp; Thomas Cubitt, the
well-known builder, born near Norwich in 1788, at an early period
in life was thrown upon his own resources, and soon learned to
trust in them.&nbsp; At the death of his father, when he was in
his nineteenth year, he was working as a journeyman
carpenter.&nbsp; He shortly afterwards, with a view to improve
his circumstances, took a voyage to India and back as
captain&rsquo;s joiner.&nbsp; On his return to London, then about
21 years of age, with the savings he had put by, he commenced a
small business in London as carpenter.&nbsp; After about six
years, appearances of success manifesting themselves, he took a
piece of ground from Lord Calthorpe in the Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road,
upon which he erected large buildings and carried on a very large
business, which business he handed over to his brother, Mr.
Alderman Cubitt, while he built what is known as Belgravia, and,
when he died, had accumulated property to the amount of a million
sterling.&nbsp; He was a man of most estimable qualities,
clear-headed, energetic, of unswerving integrity, kind to his
family, generous and considerate to his workpeople and
dependents.</p>
<p>But there are money-making men who are better than <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>mere
money-grubs.&nbsp; Mr. Gompertz, born in London in 1799, the son
of a Dutch diamond merchant, was a self-taught mathematician of
very high attainments, who had distinguished himself early in
life by the publication of new logarithms.&nbsp; At the age of
thirty, having married Miss Abigail Montefiore, sister of Sir
Moses Montefiore, Mr. Gompertz entered his name as a member of
the Stock Exchange, doing a large amount of business, but without
relinquishing his mathematical pursuits, which gradually turned
to tables connected with life insurance.&nbsp; After working out
a new series of tables of mortality, the subject took such a hold
of his mind that he decided to quit the Stock Exchange and to
devote himself entirely to actuarial science.&nbsp; Appointed
actuary of the Alliance Company under its deed of settlement, he
became, both in virtue of his position and through his high
connections, its chief manager, doing his work to the
satisfaction of the directors.&nbsp; Mr. Benjamin Gompertz,
however, aimed to be nothing more than a man of science; his
ambition being to make the best actuarial investigations, and not
to do the largest amount of business.&nbsp; Another illustration
we have of this higher life is afforded in the case of Mr.
Grote.&nbsp; Mr. Samuel Rogers may also be quoted as another
illustration.&nbsp; It is well to feel that, after all, there is
something better than money-making&mdash;that man does not live
by bread alone.</p>
<p>The great lesson of London life is, that perseverance,
industry, and integrity will win the day.&nbsp; In the City,
daily, we see the poorest rise to the possession of great wealth
and honour.&nbsp; Poor lads have come to town friendless and
moneyless; have been sober, and steady, and true to
themselves.&nbsp; They have been firm in their opposition to
London allurements and vices; have improved the abilities God has
given them, and the opportunities placed within their reach, and
become, in their way, men of note and mark.&nbsp; Many a Lord
Mayor has been an office-lad in the firm of which he grew to be
the head.&nbsp; Mr. Herbert Ingram, the founder of the
<i>Illustrated London News</i>&mdash;the tale is an old one, but
none the less true&mdash;blackened the shoes of some of the men
he afterwards represented in parliament.&nbsp; Mr. Anderson, of
the Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and formerly M.P. for the
Orkneys, rose in a similar manner.&nbsp; Mr. Dillon, of the great
house of Dillon, Morrison, &amp; Co., also rose in a similar <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>way.&nbsp;
Lord Campbell, when employment was scarce, and money ditto, held
a post as reporter and theatrical critic on the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Chaplin, who at one time represented
Salisbury in parliament was an extraordinary instance of a man
rising from the humblest rank.&nbsp; Before railways were in
operation he had succeeded in making himself one of the largest
coach proprietors in the kingdom.&nbsp; His establishment, from
small beginnings, grew till just before the opening of the London
and North-western line.&nbsp; He was proprietor of sixty-four
stage-coaches, worked by 1,500 horses, and giving yearly returns
of more than half a million sterling.&nbsp; Sir William Cubitt,
when a lad, worked at his father&rsquo;s flour-mills.&nbsp;
Michael Faraday was the son of a poor blacksmith; and J. W.
Turner, of a hairdresser in Maiden Lane.&nbsp; Mr. W. Johnson
Fox, at one time M.P. for Oldham&mdash;the great orator of the
Anti-Corn-Law League, and the &ldquo;Publicola&rdquo; of the
<i>Weekly Dispatch</i>, when that paper could afford ten guineas
a-week for a good article&mdash;was a Norwich factory lad.</p>
<p>I knew a lad, born in the village in which I was born, in the
humblest rank of life.&nbsp; I found him one day one of the
churchwardens of a city parish, and a man of substance.&nbsp; I
expressed my surprise, as even he could not read.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; was his reply, &ldquo;I came to London
determined to be a man or a mouse; and here I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is so all over London.&nbsp; The great warehouses in Cheapside
and Cannon Street, and Victoria Street and elsewhere, are mostly
owned by men who began life without a rap.&nbsp; Go to the
&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; villas around London, and ask who live
there, and you will find that they are inhabited by men whose
wealth is enormous; whose fathers were beggars; and whose career
has been a marvellous success.</p>
<p>In one of his songs, Barry Cornwall tells us, that when he was
a little boy, he was told that the streets of London were paved
with gold; and it must be admitted that, to the youthful mind in
general, the metropolis is a sort of Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground,
where gold and silver are to be picked up in handfuls any
day.&nbsp; There is a good deal, it is hardly necessary to say,
of exaggeration in this.&nbsp; To many, London is dark and dismal
as one of its fogs, and cold and stony as one of its own
streets.&nbsp; It is difficult to estimate the number of persons,
in the lowest stage of pauperism, who rise every morning <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>not knowing
where to earn their daily broad.&nbsp; Wonderful are the shifts
and ingenuities of this unfortunate class.&nbsp; One summer day a
lady friend of the writer was driving in one of the pleasant
green lanes of Hornsey, when she saw a poor woman gathering the
leaves of a horse-chestnut.&nbsp; She asked her why she did
so.&nbsp; The reply was, that she got a living by selling them to
the fruiterers in Covent Garden, who lined their baskets of fruit
with them.&nbsp; One day it came out in evidence at a
police-court, that a mother and her children earned a scanty
subsistence by rising early in the morning, or rather late at
night, and selling, as waste paper, the broad sheets and placards
with which the waste walls of the metropolis were adorned.&nbsp;
It seems to me, one of the worst sights of the outskirts of
London, is that of women, all black and grimy, sifting the
cinders and rubbish collected by the wandering dustmen.&nbsp;
Perhaps that is as dirty a way for a woman to make money as
possible; and yet it seemed to me that their hands were clean,
compared with those of certain stock and money-brokers, and
promoters of public companies, to whom it is needless more
particularly to allude.</p>
<p>Fortunes in London are made by trifles.&nbsp; I knew a man who
kept a knacker&rsquo;s yard, who lived out of town in a villa of
exquisite beauty, and who drove horses which a prince or an
American millionaire would have envied.&nbsp; Out of the profits
of his vegetable pills, Morrison bought himself a nice
estate.&nbsp; Mrs. Holloway used to be seen riding in one of the
handsomest carriages to be met with in the Strand, and the
princely liberality of Mr. Holloway astonished all England a
little while since; and as to the keepers of dining-rooms and
City taverns, how well they live, and in what good style, most of
us know well.&nbsp; Before suburban railways had become
developed, in the City was to be seen more than one proprietor of
a dining-room, who drove daily a handsome mail phaeton and pair
to town in the morning to do his business, and back at
night.&nbsp; Thackeray had a tale, if not founded on fact, at any
rate not improbable, of a gentleman who married a young lady,
drove a swell cab, and lived altogether in great style.&nbsp; The
gentleman was dumb as to his daily occupation.&nbsp; He would not
impart even the secret to his wife.&nbsp; Even the prying
mother-in-law was unable to solve the mystery.&nbsp; All that she
knew <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>was,
what everyone else knew, that her son-in-law went out in his cab,
with his tiger mounted behind, in the morning, and returned home
in the same style at night.&nbsp; At length, one day, the wife,
going with her dear mamma into the City shopping, recognised her
lord and master in the person of a street-sweeper, clothed in
rags, and covered with dirt.&nbsp; The discovery was too much for
him.&nbsp; He was never heard of more.</p>
<p>In one of his pleasant letters, Mortimer Collins
wrote&mdash;&ldquo;The modern millionaire&rsquo;s beneficence is
ostentatious.&nbsp; A thousand pounds to a charity is as good a
way of saying, &lsquo;See, I am rich,&rsquo; as the same sum
spent on a horse or a picture.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same idea has
occurred to the writer of a modern play.&nbsp; The hero calls for
his secretary, and asks him to bring him the book which contains
a list of his donations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he says, after
looking at it, &ldquo;double my subscriptions to all the
charities that advertise, and put it down to our advertising
account.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is to be feared a good deal of that
charity, which covers a multitude of sins in the City, is due to
a similar desire for publicity.&nbsp; A good deal of ostentatious
expenditure is simply put down under the head of advertising
expenditure, and very often it is the only way by means of which
a rich tradesman or ambitious merchant can draw attention to
himself and his proceedings.&nbsp; This ostentation is a little
annoying occasionally.&nbsp; For instance, it was particularly
unpleasant to Sara Coleridge, the gifted daughter of a gifted
sire.&nbsp; At Broadstairs she lodged in a house where there were
some children belonging to a London shopkeeper and his
wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;These children,&rdquo; the lady writes,
&ldquo;live on the stairs, or in the kitchen, and never take a
book or a needle in their hands, and yet their parents are
overburdening Mrs. Smith with attendance, dressing well, and
living for many weeks by the sea in commodious lodgings.&nbsp;
The extravagance and recklessness that go on in the families of
tradesmen in London, is beyond what the rank above them ever
dream of.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sara Coleridge, as the wife of a
clergyman, and daughter of the great philosopher, I dare say
found it hard to make both ends meet, and perhaps was needlessly
severe on the London tradesmen, and the way in which they spend
their money.&nbsp; Such sharp censure as she penned was natural
under the circumstances.&nbsp; Refined, genteel people, of
limited means, are sadly vexed at the riotous abundance of the
prosperous and <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>well-to-do.&nbsp; As to ostentation, Morrison, the pill
man beat every one when he gave a grand banquet to all that was
fashionable in society at Paris, and to each parting guest
presented his card, with an advertisement of his far-famed
pills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two causes led,&rdquo; writes Mr. Page, &ldquo;to the
accumulation of the wealth which Mr. Brassey realised.&nbsp; One
was the small extent of his personal expenses.&nbsp; He hated all
show, luxury, and ostentation.&nbsp; He kept but a moderate
establishment, which the increase of his means never induced him
to extend.&nbsp; He was wont to say&mdash;&lsquo;It requires a
special education to be idle, or to employ the twenty-four hours
in a rational way, without any particular calling or
occupation.&nbsp; To live the life of a gentleman one must have
been brought up to it.&nbsp; It is impossible for a man who has
been engaged in business pursuits the greater part of his life to
retire; if he does so, he soon discovers that he has made a
mistake.&nbsp; I shall not retire; but if for some good reason I
should be obliged to do so, it would be to a farm.&nbsp; There I
should bring up stock, which I should cause to be weighed every
day, ascertaining at the same time their daily cost, as against
the increasing weight.&nbsp; I should then know when to sell, and
start again with a fresh lot.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The second and
far more important cause which led to Mr. Brassey&rsquo;s wealth,
was the extent of his business.&nbsp; &ldquo;He knew the value of
money as well as any one,&rdquo; wrote a friend, &ldquo;and how
far a pound would go; but he had no greediness to acquire wealth,
and he was always willing to give away a portion of his profits
to any one who was instrumental in making them, and that to a
remarkable extent.&nbsp; At no time did he realise more than
three per cent. on the money turned over by him.&nbsp; He laid
out seventy-eight millions of other people&rsquo;s money on
works, every one of which was of public utility; and upon that
outlay he retained two millions and a-half.&nbsp; Mr.
Brassey&rsquo;s financial management was very simple; on each
contract the agent was responsible for the money he received; he
relied upon the cashier to keep the accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The money-making men have, some of them, done good service in
their day and generation.&nbsp; To the latter class emphatically
belongs George Grote, the historian, whose grandfather came over
to this country from Bremen, and established the banking-house of
Grote, Prescott, and Co., on the <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>1st of January, 1766.&nbsp; At the
early age of sixteen he was placed in the banking-house in
Threadneedle Street, and commenced a business career, which he
carried on thirty two years; when, having enough to live on, he
retired, to devote himself more particularly to historical
studies.&nbsp; And to his house in Threadneedle Street came the
Mills (father and son), Mr. David Ricardo, Mr. John Smith, M.P.,
Dr. Black, of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, and Mr. Charles
Austin, whom Mrs. Grote describes as the most brilliant
conversationalist of his time.</p>
<p>Some of our greatest lawyers became moneyed men by habits of
extreme economy in their young days.&nbsp; Lord Kenyon commenced
his London career by lodging in Bell Yard, Carey Street, and
paying for the accommodation six shillings a-week.&nbsp; His
friends at this time were Dunning and Horne Tooke.&nbsp; They
used generally to dine, in vacation time, at a small eating-house
near Chancery Lane, where their meal was supplied to them at the
charge of 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> a-head.&nbsp; Tooke, in giving an
account of these repasts many years after, used to say,
&ldquo;Dunning and myself were generous, for we gave the girl who
waited upon us a penny a-piece; but Kenyon, who knew the value of
money, rewarded her with a halfpenny, and sometimes a
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Addison&rsquo;s club, as wittily described in the
<i>Spectator</i>, the City merchant who has made his fortune
figures in a very favourable light.&nbsp; &ldquo;His notions of
trade are,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;noble and generous; and as
every rich man usually has some sly way of jesting, which would
make no great figure were he not a rich man, he calls the sea the
British common.&nbsp; He is acquainted with commerce in all its
parts, and will tell you that it is a stupid and barbarous way to
extend dominion by arms, for that power is to be got by arts and
industry.&nbsp; He will often argue, that if this part of our
trade was well cultivated, we should gain from one nation; and if
another, from another.&nbsp; I have heard him prove that
diligence makes more lasting acquisitions than valour, and that
sloth has ruined more nations than the sword.&nbsp; He abounds in
several frugal maxims, among which the greatest favourite is,
&lsquo;A penny saved is a penny gained.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Londoners must ever feel grateful to Addison for his genial
sketch of Sir Andrew Freeport.</p>
<p>Money-making men, even in their charities, have an eye to the
main chance.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Greville Memoirs,&rdquo; we read
that <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Southey told an anecdote of Sir Massey Lopes, which is a
good story of a miser.&nbsp; A man came to him and told him he
was in great distress, and that &pound;200 would save him.&nbsp;
He gave him a draft for the money.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;what will you do with this?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go to
the bankers and get it cashed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I will cash it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he gave him the
money, but first calculated and deducted the discount&mdash;thus
at once exercising his benevolence and his avarice.</p>
<p>Money-making has its disadvantages.&nbsp; There was a Lord
Compton, who ran away with a rich citizen&rsquo;s
daughter&mdash;I refer to Sir John Spencer, to whom there is such
a fine monument in St. Helen&rsquo;s, Bishopsgate.&nbsp; When the
nobleman became, by the death of Sir John, possessor of his
fortune, it is reported that for the time his lordship became
stark staring mad, and had to be confined.&nbsp; And this reminds
me, that City men, who are considered &ldquo;warm&rdquo; in a
worldly point of view, are apt to make great mistakes as to
getting their daughters married.&nbsp; It is not unfrequently
that they allow cash considerations too much to interpose, and
thus many an advantageous marriage is frustrated.&nbsp; It is not
what a man has, but what a man is, that is the true test of
character; and a citizen who has well feathered his nest, and who
thinks of the store laid up in his barn, and of his cattle, and
sheep, and other substance, is too apt to overlook the fact, that
a clever man, even if he be poor, may become rich and
great.&nbsp; In the life of the Claytons we have a case in point
relating to the late Lord Truro.&nbsp; &ldquo;When a young man,
and beginning his honourable career, he formed a strong
attachment to an amiable and elegant lady, the daughter of a
merchant in the City, and a member of Mr. Clayton&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; His offer, as a suitor, would have been responded
to by the lady, but met with a stern and inflexible opposition
from her father, on the ground of the pecuniary inequality that
there appeared between them; and thus the City merchant lost a
lord for a son-in-law.&rdquo;&nbsp; One money-making City man is
to be specially remembered as a warning to rich capitalists as to
how they make their wills.&nbsp; I refer to Mr. Peter Thellusson,
the banker.&nbsp; At the age of threescore-and-ten, Mr.
Thellusson found that he was the owner of &pound;6,000,000 in
hard cash, besides an annual rent-roll of &pound;9,500.&nbsp;
This was not enough for the ambitious Peter; and hence that
wonderful will, which was such a fortune to the lawyers.&nbsp; He
left about <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&pound;100,000 to his wife and his three sons and
daughter; and the rest of his fortune, amounting to more than
&pound;6,000,000, was conveyed to trustees, who were to let it
accumulate till after the deaths, not only of his children, but
of all the male issue of his sons and grandsons.&nbsp; After that
event, the vast property, with its accumulations at compound
interest, was to be given to the nearest male descendant who
should bear the family name of Thellusson, and then the great
mountain of accumulated wealth was to be divided into three
portions.&nbsp; It was a fine will for the lawyers.&nbsp; In two
years after Peter Thellusson was gathered to his fathers; two
bills had been filed in Chancery impeaching the will&mdash;the
one by his wife and children, the other by his trustees; and the
litigation lasted for sixty years.&nbsp; The wife of the
millionaire died, it is said, of a broken heart; and the Court of
Chancery so clipped and pollarded Peter Thellusson&rsquo;s oak,
that when they had done with it, it was not much larger than when
he left it.&nbsp; Nor was this all.&nbsp; Parliament took the
matter up; and though they would not set aside the will, they
enacted that the power of devising property for the purpose of
accumulation should be restricted to twenty-one years after the
death of the testator.</p>
<p>At the head of the money-making men, I suppose, are to be
placed &ldquo;Plum Turner&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vulture
Hopkins.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former, who was a Turkey merchant, died
in 1793.&nbsp; When possessed of &pound;300,000 he laid down his
carriage because interest was reduced from five to four per
cent.&nbsp; Vulture Hopkins, as Pope, in his satire, calls him, I
fancy has been abused much more than he deserved.&nbsp; He was a
wealthy merchant; the architect of his own fortune; and resided
in Broad Street.&nbsp; That he was a very economical man there
can be no doubt.&nbsp; We are told he paid an evening visit to
Guy, the founder of the hospital in Southwark, and the story is
too characteristic to be omitted.&nbsp; Guy lighted a farthing
candle for the reception of his guest, who explained that he had
come to learn from him the art of frugality.&nbsp; &ldquo;And is
that all you come about?&rdquo; replied Guy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
then, we can talk the matter over in the dark.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another man of money was Sir John Cutler, a member of the
Grocers&rsquo; Company, to whom the physicians had erected a
statue in Warwick Lane, but from which they erased the
subscription which adorned it when the executors claimed the cash
which they considered <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>given.&nbsp; Some of these men had
pompous funerals.&nbsp; That of Sir John Cutler cost no less than
&pound;7,000.&nbsp; Cooke, the great sugar-baker, who died in
1811 at Pentonville, had a grand funeral; but the mob pelted the
procession with cabbage-stalks.&nbsp; He, however, atoned in some
degree for his avarice by leaving &pound;10,000 to four
charitable institutions.&nbsp; There is little virtue in being
liberal with one&rsquo;s money when one has no further need of
it; but society gains, and such men as Guy, in spite of all their
meanness, are public benefactors.&nbsp; At any rate, the study of
the lives of these men is interesting.&nbsp; It is no great art,
that of money-making; but it is natural that a City man should
try to make money, and that he should be interested in the lives
of those who have succeeded by their industry, or their luck, or
their talent, in this respect.&nbsp; I find that in this, as in
other matters, a man may be too clever by half, and that, as a
rule, honesty is the best policy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have tried them
both,&rdquo; said the Yorkshireman to his sons on his
death-bed.&nbsp; And the testimony of the Old Bailey is equally
conclusive.&nbsp; Among the Jews, success in business was
believed to be a blessing; but in our more critical age we can
see that, to gain wealth, much of the charm of life has to be
sacrificed, and that gold may be bought too dear.&nbsp; It is the
opinion of most people that it is easier to make a fortune than
to keep it.</p>
<p>Entered in &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Diaries,&rdquo; it
is really wonderful what a volume of recollections and statements
there are relating to City ways and City life.&nbsp; Every one,
of course, comes to London, and is more or less connected with
that great hive of industry and enterprise known as &ldquo;the
City.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the latest anecdotes is the following,
relating to the origin of a great City house, to which in these
scraps we have before adverted:&mdash;&ldquo;On the 1st of
January, 1818,&rdquo; writes Mr. Macaulay, &ldquo;a new tragedy
was produced at Covent Garden.&nbsp; The author, John Dillon, a
very young man, was the librarian of Dr. Simmons, of Paddington,
famous for a very splendid collection of valuable books.&nbsp;
With great promise of dramatic power, as evinced in this his
first essay, he wisely left the poet&rsquo;s idle trade for the
more lucrative pursuits of commerce, and became partner in the
well-known firm of Morrison, Dillon, and Co.&nbsp; This play was
called <i>Retribution</i>, and the chief weight of which&mdash;in
a very powerful character, Varanes&mdash;was on the shoulders of
O&rsquo;Neill.&nbsp; <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Charles Kemble and Terry were his
supporters&mdash;the villain of the story being well
represented.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the person of Mr. Frank Dillon the
artistic taste of the father has proved itself to be
hereditary.</p>
<p>Another money-making man was the founder of the Baring
family.&nbsp; The origin of them in England is to be traced to
Johan Baring, son of a Lutheran pastor in Bremen.&nbsp; Johan,
when still a lad of sixteen or seventeen, came to England,
engaged for a few years in clerkly duties, studied hard, amassed
a little money, and finally settled down as a cloth merchant and
manufacturer, in a little village near Exeter.&nbsp; He had four
sons; and the third of them, Francis, born 1740, came to London,
where, after finishing his education at Mr. Fuller&rsquo;s
academy in Lothbury, he set up in business as an importer of wool
and dye-stuffs, also acting as agent for the original family
cloth factory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Starting,&rdquo; writes Mr. Frederick
Martin, &ldquo;with a fixed determination to become rich, and
having a fair amount of money to begin with, he was uniformly
successful in all his designs.&nbsp; Nothing failed that he
undertook, and whatever he touched became gold.&nbsp; Having
amassed a fortune by dealing in cloth, wool, and dye-stuffs, he
resolved to quintuple the fortune by dealing in money
itself&mdash;that is, to be a banker.&rdquo;&nbsp; As was
natural, the successful man became also the honoured man&mdash;a
leading director of the East India Company, and the friend and
adviser of the premier, Lord Shelburne, who invariably followed
his counsels in matters of finance.&nbsp; After obtaining a seat
in parliament for Exeter, the son of Johan Baring was made a
baronet, under patent of May 29th, 1793, by William Pitt,
Shelburne&rsquo;s successor in the government, after the short
interregnum of the Duke of Portland.&nbsp; Valuing the friendship
of the shrewd man of finance, William Pitt, as much as the Earl
of Shelburne, listened to the counsel of Sir Francis Baring, both
statesmen delighting to style the reputed possessor of two
millions, on all occasions, &ldquo;the prince of
merchants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is another great house now flourishing in the City, of
whose origin a still more extraordinary tale is told.&nbsp; One
of the family is now a baronet and an M.P.; and yet the first of
the line, he who laid the foundation of the fortune of his
descendants, was a ragged street boy.</p>
<p>A curious anecdote relative to Nathan Rothschild and Mr. <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Gompertz, not
many years ago, found its way into print.&nbsp; Nathan (so the
story runs) was leaning one day, early in the spring of 1824,
against his favourite pillar in the Royal Exchange&mdash;long
known as &ldquo;the Rothschild pillar&rdquo;&mdash;his hands in
his pockets, when his relative, Gompertz, ran up to him in a high
state of excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vat ish de matter?&rdquo;
queried Rothschild.&nbsp; Thereupon the other recounted, in
gasps, how he had been applying for the vacant actuaryship of a
large insurance company, and had been beaten in the
competition.&nbsp; Though being admittedly the best candidate, on
account of his religion, the directors declared they would have
no Jew.&nbsp; Now Nathan, too, got excited.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Vat!&rdquo; he cried, disengaging his hands from his
pockets, and laying hold of his brother-in-law by the shoulders,
&ldquo;Not take you pecause of your religion!&nbsp; Mein
Gott!&nbsp; Den I will make a bigger office for you than any of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Nathan was as good as his word,
founding not only a bigger company than any other, but appointing
Mr. Gompertz actuary under the deed of settlement.</p>
<p>Let me remark here, by way of parenthesis, that it is seldom,
however, this kind of thing succeeds.&nbsp; A man who starts a
business in a passion, merely to injure another, generally comes
to grief.&nbsp; A remarkable illustration of this occurred, a few
years since, in the case of the <i>Illustrated News of the
World</i>.&nbsp; It was started by a gentleman who had long
coveted the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, and had agreed, on
one occasion, to purchase that paper of its original proprietor,
the late Mr. Herbert Ingram.&nbsp; Negotiations had been carried
on for that purpose, the price was named, and almost every detail
was settled, when Mr. Ingram wrote to say that, on reconsidering
the matter, he was determined not to part with the journal in
question.&nbsp; The result was the establishment, in opposition,
of the <i>Illustrated News of the World</i>, and the bankruptcy
of the proprietor, who died hardly better off than a
pauper.&nbsp; If Nathan Rothschild&rsquo;s new venture succeeded,
it was, under the circumstances, an exception to the general
rule.</p>
<p>Next to making a business for one&rsquo;s-self, the best way
of growing rich undoubtedly is to purchase the business of one
who has done well for himself, but who leaves a few ears of corn
for his successors to glean.&nbsp; When Mr. Barclay, who
purchased the property of Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s brewery, &amp;c.,
asked <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Dr.
Johnson, who was one of the executors, what it was that he was
going to purchase&mdash;how many were the brewing-tubs, drays,
horses, and so forth&mdash;the latter replied, &ldquo;Sir, I
cannot enumerate them; but it is of more consequence to you to
know that you have the potentiality of growing rich beyond the
dreams of avarice.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as it turned out, Johnson
was correct in his surmise.</p>
<p>The name of Gideon is now little heard; but at one time, most
assuredly, he was one of our merchant princes.&nbsp; I refer to
Simeon Gideon, who knew how to make himself the friend of Robert
Walpole, who was tolerant enough to avail himself of the help of
a Jew in those financial complications in which he was
necessarily concerned.&nbsp; One of the principal sources of
revenue for the State were lotteries, and it was thus Gideon made
his money.&nbsp; But he made his masterstroke in 1745, when the
great Jacobite insurrection threw the British world, and the
mercantile public especially, into the wildest
consternation.&nbsp; The panic on &rsquo;Change was
universal.&nbsp; The funds fell with incredible rapidity, and men
wanted to sell at any price.&nbsp; Simeon Gideon was almost the
only man who did not lose his head.&nbsp; Instead of selling, he
spent every penny he had, or could borrow, in buying.&nbsp; This
was in the month of November.&nbsp; During the following month,
the public mind oscillated between hope and fear.&nbsp; At
length, at the end of April, 1746, the news arrived of the battle
of Culloden, of the complete defeat of the insurgent army, of the
flight of the Pretender, and of the triumphant suppression of the
rebellion by the Duke of Cumberland.&nbsp; It was then Simeon
Gideon began to sell, and found himself in possession of
something like a quarter of a million&mdash;a sum which, in the
course of fourteen or fifteen years, quadrupled itself.&nbsp;
Gideon&rsquo;s ambition was to found an English house.&nbsp; He
was too old, he said, to change his religion, but he had his
children baptized; and through Walpole&rsquo;s instrumentality,
his eldest son was made a baronet when in his eleventh
year.&nbsp; It was hard work for Gideon <i>p&egrave;re</i> to
make a Christian of the lad.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who made thee?&rdquo;
on one occasion he asked the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;God,&rdquo; was
the proper reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who redeemed thee?&rdquo; was the
next question, to which the boy replied, &ldquo;Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then came a third question, which the father
had unfortunately forgotten.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&mdash;who,&rdquo;
he stammered; and then, nothing better occurring to <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>him, he
asked, &ldquo;Who has given you this hat?&rdquo;&nbsp; The young
catechumen is reported to have confidently replied, &ldquo;The
Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gideon, senior, died in the faith of his
fathers in 1762.&nbsp; He left behind him, as heirs of his
immense fortune, a son and a daughter, and legacies amounting to
about 100,000 thalers, which were to be divided equally between
Jewish and Christian benevolent societies and the poor.&nbsp; We
read in a letter of a contemporary&mdash;&ldquo;Gideon is dead,
and his whole inheritance is worth more than the whole of
Canaan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another star which dawned in the commercial world about the
same time, was Aaron Goldsmid.&nbsp; He came from Hamburg, and
established himself in London, as a merchant, in the middle of
the last century.&nbsp; The house arrived at its highest
prosperity after his death, under his four sons.&nbsp; At the
head of the business were then two brothers, Abraham and
Benjamin, men of acknowledged integrity, and allied in friendship
with Newland, the head cashier of the Bank of England.&nbsp; He
was also a self-made man, who had risen from a baker&rsquo;s shop
to his enormously influential position.&nbsp; By means of
Newland, the brothers Goldsmid were brought into connection with
the government, which, since the year 1793, had been compelled to
have recourse to continual loans, in consequence of the
Continental war.&nbsp; But it was not only through this that they
made their money.&nbsp; It was their cleverness and knowledge
that saved them from losing money, when all over Europe great
mercantile houses were breaking.&nbsp; One of the most notable
characteristics of Benjamin was, we are told, his astonishing
knowledge of firms, which was not confined merely to England, but
embraced the whole money-market in or out of England.&nbsp; He
valued, with a certainty bordering on the marvellous, every name
on the back of a bill.&nbsp; In the panic year of 1790, the house
only lost &pound;50, when ruin swept away many of the chief firms
of England and abroad.&nbsp; At the beginning of the present
century, there was no house greater, or more universally
esteemed; and yet the end was tragic in the extreme.&nbsp; One
morning in April, 1808, Benjamin Goldsmid hung himself in his
bed-room.&nbsp; In 1810, the elder brother, Abraham, in
conjunction with the house of Baring, embarked in a government
loan of &pound;14,000,000.&nbsp; The business failed; the house
of Baring survived the crash; but Abraham Goldsmid shot <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>himself when
he found how true it was that riches take to themselves wings,
and fly away.</p>
<p>Here is a story of an alderman, extracted from
<i>Maloniana</i>.&nbsp; When the late Mr. Pitt, or Alderman
Beckford, made a strong attack on the late Sir William Baker,
alderman of London, charging him with having made an immense sum
by a fraudulent contract, he got up very quietly, and gained the
House to his side by this short reply: &ldquo;The honourable
gentleman is a great orator, and has made a long and serious
charge against me.&nbsp; I am no orator, and shall therefore only
answer it in two words&mdash;Prove it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having thus
spoken, he sat down; but there was something in his tone and
manner that satisfied the House the charge was a calumny.</p>
<p>In 1736, there was&mdash;as I dare say there is now&mdash;an
old Mr. Collier in the City.&nbsp; He lived in Essex, and his
daughter&mdash;as is generally the case with rich City
men&mdash;soon got married.&nbsp; It was thus the Rev. Dr.
Taylor, of Isleworth, in 1788, described the
wedding;&mdash;&ldquo;Old Mr. Collier was a very vain man, who
had made his fortune in the South Sea year: and having been
originally a merchant, was fond, alter he had retired to live
upon his fortune, of a great deal of display and parade.&nbsp; On
his daughter&rsquo;s wedding, therefore, he invited nearly fifty
persons, and got two or three capital cooks from London to
prepare a magnificent entertainment in honour of the day.&nbsp;
When other ceremonies had concluded, the young couple were put to
bed, and every one of the numerous assemblage came into the room
to make these congratulations to the father and mother, who sat
up in bed to receive them: &lsquo;Madame, I wish you a very
good-night.&nbsp; Sir, all happiness to you, and a very
good-night,&rsquo; and so on through the whole party.&nbsp; My
father, who hated all parade, but was forced to submit to the old
gentleman&rsquo;s humour, must have been in a fine fume; and my
mother, who was then but seventeen or eighteen, sufficiently
embarrassed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is as well rich citizens don&rsquo;t
indulge in such a display on the occasion of a marriage in the
family in our time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t fancy even a Lord Mayor,
however fond of antiquity, would feel himself justified in
attempting anything so ridiculous now.&nbsp; But then it was the
fashion for a well-bred youth to address his father as
&ldquo;honoured sir,&rdquo; and not as now, as
&ldquo;governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another money-making family was that of the Hopes, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>originally
from Holland.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. William Hope,&rdquo; says old
Captain Gronow, &ldquo;inherited, on coming of age, &pound;40,000
a-year.&nbsp; He exhibited, alternately, extreme recklessness in
expenditure, and the stinginess of a miser.&nbsp; He would one
day spend thousands of pounds on a ball or supper, and then keep
his servants for days on cold meat and stale bread.&nbsp; His
large fortune enabled him to give the most splendid
entertainments to the <i>beau monde</i> of Paris.&nbsp; At his
balls and parties all the notables of the day were to be seen,
and no expense was spared to make them the most sumptuous
entertainments then given.&nbsp; It was his custom, when the
invitations were issued, not to open any letters till the party
was over, to save him the mortification of refusing those who had
not been invited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are to believe the great poet, who mostly spent his life
in London, and whose name still graces a street very much reduced
from what it was in his day, Mammon-worship must have a very bad
moral effect, for Mammon was the least erected spirit that fell
from heaven; and even there we are told&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;His
looks and thoughts<br />
Were always downward bent, admiring more<br />
The riches of heaven&rsquo;s pavement, trodden gold,<br />
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed<br />
In vision beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, some of Mammon&rsquo;s worshippers have found
time and money for better things, and have consecrated their
wealth to noble ends.&nbsp; In Roman Catholic times this was to
be expected.&nbsp; A princely bequest, at the dictation of the
priest, was a fitting atonement for ill-gotten wealth or an
ill-spent life; but Protestantism has been equally
conspicuous&mdash;and, it is to be believed, from better
motives&mdash;for good works, and that charity which covereth a
multitude of sins.&nbsp; In illustration of this, there is,
perhaps, no brighter name than that of Joseph Hardcastle, of whom
it is well known that, amid all his varied and extensive
engagements, he maintained a character for spotless honour and
unsullied integrity, which even calumny itself never ventured to
assail.&nbsp; To him, from the very outset, belonged the
reputation of the English merchant of the old school, and years
served only to augment that weight of character which he bore on
the Exchange, as well as in the missionary and other
societies.&nbsp; He was one of <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the founders of the Sierra Leone
Company, along with Wilberforce and Thornton.&nbsp; Also he was
treasurer of the Missionary Society.&nbsp; In 1799, the Religions
Tract Society was founded under his roof.&nbsp; And at his
offices, Old Swan Stairs, the Bible Society was first launched
into existence.&nbsp; The Hibernian Society and the Village
Itinerary Society were aided by his purse and presence.&nbsp; Of
the latter society he was treasurer sixteen years.&nbsp; As he
came of an old Nonconformist stock&mdash;one of his ancestors was
an ejected clergyman&mdash;Mr. Hardcastle, who lived mainly at
Hatcham, was buried in Bunhill Fields.</p>
<p>In Plough Court, Lombard Street, there was a firm well-known
and highly respected.&nbsp; It was a firm long remarkable for the
extraordinary philanthropic activity of its practices, and for
the excellence of its chemicals.&nbsp; Mr. Allen, the senior
partner, was a lecturer in chemistry at Guy&rsquo;s Hospital, a
Fellow of the Royal Society, a personal and intimate friend of
the Duke of Kent, the Duke of Sussex, Lord Brougham, Sir Fowell
Buxton, the Gurneys, Thomas Clarckson, and many other of the
leading philanthropic and public characters of the past
generation.&nbsp; He was also a minister among the Quakers, and a
prime mover in founding a host of schools, asylums, and
benevolent institutions.&nbsp; Another partner in the firm was
the late Luke Ronard, F.R.S., the eminent meteorologist, who was
also a preacher among the Quakers till the last portion of his
life, when he joined the communion of the Plymouth Brethren, with
whom also he was an active labourer in good efforts of various
kinds.&nbsp; A third partner of the firm was the late Mr. John
Thomas, who, after his very accurate and skilful scientific
researches had gained him a competency, retired from business,
and devoted the remainder of his life to an extraordinary series
of efforts, in conjunction with Mr. William Ewart, M.P., Mr.
Barret Lennard, M.P., Mr. John Sydney Taylor, the editor of the
<i>Morning Herald</i>, the Right Hon. Stephen Lushington, D.C.L.,
and the late Mr. Peter Bedford, of Croydon, for the removal of
the punishment of death from the numerous offences, some of them
very trivial, for which it was at one time inflicted.&nbsp; A
writer in the <i>Sunday at Home</i>, in the year 1866, remarks,
that it is no exaggeration to say, that the splendid triumphs of
mercy, which have rendered the reign of King William IV. for ever
illustrious in history, were, either directly or indirectly, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>largely owing
to the strenuous, continuous, and truly wonderful labours of Mr.
Barry and this small group of his philanthropic coadjutors.&nbsp;
Such were the partners in the firm at Plough Court, a house
frequented by all classes of men&mdash;by princes of the
blood-royal, by peers and statesmen, by scientific discoverers
and professors, by missionaries and preachers, by schoolmasters
and authors, by reformed criminals and escaped slaves.&nbsp; It
became a centre of conference and movement for much of the
metropolitan philanthropy during the reigns of George IV. and
William IV.</p>
<p>It is to the credit of the City that some of these
money-making men have been amongst the most earnest supporters of
every religious and philanthropic enterprise.&nbsp; Here we get a
pleasant glimpse of one of them.&nbsp; Heard writes to
Wilberforce, in 1790, of the death of John
Thornton:&mdash;&ldquo;He was allied to me by relationship and
family connection.&nbsp; His character is so well known that it
is scarcely necessary to attempt its delineation.&nbsp; It may be
useful, however, to state, that it was by living with great
simplicity of intention and conduct in the practice of Christian
life, more than of any superiority of understanding or of
knowledge, that he rendered his name illustrious in the view of
all the respectable part of his contemporaries.&nbsp; He had a
counting-house in London, and a handsome villa at Clapham.&nbsp;
He anticipated the disposition and pursuits of the succeeding
generation.&nbsp; He devoted large sums annually to charitable
purposes, especially to the promotion of the cause of religion,
both in his own and other countries.&nbsp; He assisted many
clergymen, enabling them to live in comfort, and to practise a
useful hospitality.&nbsp; His personal habits were remarkably
simple.&nbsp; His dinner-hour was two o&rsquo;clock; he generally
attended public worship at some church or Episcopalian chapel
several evenings in the week, and would often sit up to a late
hour in his own study, at the top of the house, engaged in
religious exercises.&nbsp; He died without a groan or a struggle,
and in the full view of glory.&nbsp; Oh, may my end be like
his!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the Sir James Stephen in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> for 1844, &ldquo;a merchant renowned in
his generation for a munificence more than princely.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Thornton was an Episcopalian, and it was owing to him that
the venerable John Newton became pastor of St. Mary
Woolnoth.&nbsp; His benevolence was as unsectarian as his general
habits; and he stood ready, said Mr. <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Cecil, to assist a beneficent design
in any party, but would be the creature of none.&nbsp; It was
thus he was mainly instrumental in founding, and supporting for a
while, a Dissenting academy at Newport-Pagnell, which was placed
under the care of the Rev. Josiah Bull.&nbsp; Also he extended
his patronage and pecuniary assistance to the institution at
Marlborough, under the direction of the Rev. Cornelius Winter,
and was thus brought into connection with Mr. Jay, towards whose
support he contributed while passing through his academic
course.&nbsp; Mr. Thornton spent myriads of pounds in the
purchase of livings for evangelical preachers, in the erection
and in enlargement of places of worship, both in the Church of
England and among Dissenters, in sending out Bibles and religions
books by his ships to various parts of the world, and in numerous
other ways.&nbsp; Nor was his beneficence exclusively confined to
religious objects.&nbsp; Mr. Newton says&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Bull
told my father, that while he (Mr. Newton) was at Olney, he had
received from Mr. Thornton more than &pound;2,000 for the poor of
that place.&nbsp; He not only,&rdquo; continued Mr. Bull,
&ldquo;gave largely, but he gave wisely.&nbsp; He kept a regular
account&mdash;not for ostentation, or the gratification of
vanity, but for method&mdash;of every pound he gave in a ledger,
which he once showed me.&nbsp; I was then a boy, and, I remarked,
on every page was an appropriate text.&nbsp; With him giving was
a matter of business.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cowper, in an elegy he wrote
upon him, said truly&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou hadst an interest in doing good,<br />
Restless as his who toils and sweats for food.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is needless to add that he lived at Clapham, and had
Wilberforce for a nephew.&nbsp; His son, Henry Thornton, M.P. for
Southwark, followed in his father&rsquo;s steps to a certain
extent.&nbsp; One day, when he was at Bath, he desired Jay to
bring with him Foster, the essayist, to dinner.&nbsp; The attempt
was a failure.&nbsp; Jay writes&mdash;&ldquo;Mortifyingly he
(Foster) again showed his indisposition to talk; and our most
excellent entertainer was not much favoured to make his company
easy and free and communicative, for his manner was particularly
cold, distant, and reserved.&nbsp; Foster said&mdash;yet I think
very untruly&mdash;that he sat as if he had a bag of money under
his arm; but at this time Mr. Foster had a silly kind of
prejudice <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>against persons of affluence, however their wealth had
been obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us recall the memory of Mr. John Poynder.&nbsp; As an East
Indian proprietor he spoke much in favour of the abolition of
Sutteeism, and against the monstrous tax arising from the
idolatrous worship of Juggernaut.&nbsp; His publications were
numerous, and chiefly on religious subjects&mdash;the
evangelisation of our East Indian dominions, the paganism of
popery, the sanctification of the Lord&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; He was
a staunch Tory and churchman; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; writes Jay, of
Bath, &ldquo;never was there a warmer advocate of evangelical
truth and the doctrines of the Reformation; never was there a
more determined enemy to popery and its half-sister, Puseyism;
never did man more strive to serve his generation by the will of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; A name that should be dear to Dissenters is
that of Mr. William Coward, who was the friend of Doddridge, and
who supplied the funds for his college for the training of
Congregational ministers, first at Daventry, and afterwards at
Wymondley, and now in Torrington Square, when the students were
entered at University College.&nbsp; Coward College is now
incorporated in the New College, St. John&rsquo;s Wood.&nbsp; Mr.
Coward was rather an eccentric in 1732, Dr. Jennings first
intimated Mr. Coward&rsquo;s idea to Doddridge, and recommended
him not to comply with Mr. Coward&rsquo;s idea to come and live
at Walthamstow, where the latter lived; adding, &ldquo;that the
likeliest way to keep it in the worthy old gentleman&rsquo;s good
graces, is perhaps, not to be quite so near him.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
a note, the editor of the Doddridge correspondence
adds&mdash;&ldquo;William Coward, Esq., was a zealous
Nonconformist, having accumulated a large fortune as a
merchant.&nbsp; It may be said,&rdquo; adds the editor,
&ldquo;that Mr. Coward still continues a generous benefactor to
the cause of Nonconformity, as he left about &pound;20,000, the
interest of which is, in accordance with the provisions of his
will, distributed in its service by four trustees, whose number
must always be maintained, and who have hitherto conducted their
important duties with so much propriety that their conduct has
not in any instance been questioned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Coward
seems to have defrayed the expenses of a volume of sermons
published by Dr. Doddridge.&nbsp; Mr. Coward had a will of his
own, and some of his regulations may seem to us not a little
whimsical.&nbsp; One was to receive no guest at his mansion after
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the hour
of eight.&nbsp; The Rev. Hugh Farmer had a comical experience of
this when, about that hour, he knocked for admission in
vain.&nbsp; Mr. Farmer, after repeated raps at the floor, began
to feel uncomfortable.&nbsp; While involved in this dilemma he
was observed by a footman of Mr. Snell&rsquo;s, who was passing
near on his way home, and who reported to his master that a
strange gentleman was trying to gain admittance at Mr.
Coward&rsquo;s beyond the hour.&nbsp; The hospitable Mr. Snell
immediately sent to say that his door was open; and from that
evening the celebrated Mr. Farmer&mdash;he was a favourite pupil
of Dodderidge, and was thought in many respects to resemble
him&mdash;became a permanent member of Mr. Snell&rsquo;s family
circle.&nbsp; Mr. Coward seems to have had a keen eye for
orthodoxy, and complained of Dr. Watts that he was a
Baxterian.&nbsp; He is also reported as growing cold to Dr. Guyse
and Dr. Jennings, and falling most passionately in love with Dr.
Taylor.&nbsp; Mr. Coward seems to have died in 1738.&nbsp; In
1818, there was a wealthy stock-broker&mdash;the late Mr. Thomas
Thompson, of Pondsfort Park, who was deeply grieved with the
destitute condition of the seamen in the port of London.&nbsp; In
the February of that year a meeting on the subject was held in
the London Tavern, to form a provisional committee to purchase
and prepare a ship.&nbsp; At a subsequent meeting, it was
announced that the <i>Speedy</i>, an old sloop-of-war, had been
purchased of the government, and fitted up at a cost of nearly
&pound;3,000, to seat 750 hearers.&nbsp; The opening services on
board the floating chapel were held on May 4th, when three
sermons were preached&mdash;that in the morning by the Rev.
Rowland Hill.&nbsp; Mr. Thompson called on the reverend
gentleman, stated the neglected condition of sailors, and the
plans in contemplation, and begged him to consent to preach the
opening sermon on board the floating chapel.&nbsp; Mr. Hill heard
all, rang the bell in silence, and his old servant
appeared.&nbsp; &ldquo;John,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fetch my
pocket-book.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Hill, who had hitherto been a
quiet listener, now interposed, asserting that his engagements
were already too numerous, and that he would wear himself
out.&nbsp; Stroking his chin and shaking his head, with his
characteristic habit, he replied, &ldquo;My dear, I must preach
for poor Jack.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus was the first floating chapel
for sailors happily launched, and the Port of London Society for
the Spiritual Benefit of Sailors brought into active
operation.&nbsp; To the ship, and the general <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>objects of
the society, Mr. Smith contributed, from first to last, about
&pound;3,000.&nbsp; Another society, called into existence by Mr.
Thompson&rsquo;s activity and Christian devotedness and
liberality, was the Home Missionary Society, which was
inaugurated at the London Tavern on August 11th, 1819.&nbsp; At
that time Mr. Thompson resided at Brixton Hill, and on week-day
evenings held religious meetings amongst the neglected poor of
that district and of Streatham.&nbsp; Gas-lights and police being
then unknown, Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s family were thankful when he
came home from these charitable peregrinations safe and
sound.&nbsp; It must be remarked here that Mr. Thompson was one
of the founders, in 1827, of the Merchant Seamen&rsquo;s Orphan
Asylum.&nbsp; The first election was for five boys only, but it
soon became a large and flourishing institution.&nbsp; Though a
Dissenter, the Pastoral Aid and Special Services Aid Societies
owed him much.&nbsp; As his daughter truly writes of
him&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Thompson was one of those who helped to
mould the benevolent character of the age in which he
lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another name, well known in religious circles, was that of the
late Mr. Thomas Wilson, who was the first to begin
chapel-building on a large scale in London.&nbsp; Even in our
more ostentatious day, Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s charities would be
considered princely.</p>
<p>And here, for the present, we take leave of the Christian
merchant princes of London&mdash;the righteous men who possibly
may have preserved it from the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p>In the great medi&aelig;val cities of the continent, it was
the men who had made money by trade who were the first to spend
it liberally for the promotion of art, and the benefit of charity
and religion.&nbsp; It has been so in London.&nbsp; Our Norman
barons, our men with pedigrees running up to the time of the
Conqueror, have done little for the welfare of the people,
compared with the men of humble birth, who, as they have grown in
wealth, have also grown in their estimate of its power to help
those lower in the social scale than themselves.</p>

35</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is in America, as was to be
expected, that rise more quickly than in any other country.&nbsp;
Every one is ambitious, and there he realises the fact that no
position is beyond his power if he will but work for it.&nbsp;
Franklin was a printer&rsquo;s boy, General Putnam was a farmer,
Roger Sherman was a shoemaker, and Andrew Jackson was a poor boy,
who worked his way up from the humblest position; Patrick Henry,
the great American orator, was a country tavern-keeper; Abraham
Lincoln was equally low placed in his start in life.&nbsp; But
even in America it is hard work to make a fortune.&nbsp; Niorse,
an American artist, but a better chemist and mechanician than a
painter, thought out the magnetic telegraph on a Havre
packet-ship, but met the common fate of inventors.&nbsp; He
struggled for years with poverty and a thousand
difficulties.&nbsp; He failed to interest capitalists.&nbsp; At
last, when he was yielding to despair, and meditated suicide, on
the last night of a session of Congress, at midnight, when the
Appropriation Bill was being rushed through, he got an
appropriation of &pound;6,000 for an experimental line between
Washington and Baltimore; then success, rewards, honours, titles
of nobility, gold medals, and an immense fortune.&nbsp; The
American inventor of the sewing machine had similar misfortune,
and then as great a success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two kinds of men and two kinds of business in
New York,&rdquo; says an American author.&nbsp; The old-school
merchants of New York are few; their ranks are thinning every
day.&nbsp; They were distinguished for probity and honour; they
took time to make a fortune.&nbsp; Their success proved that
business success and mercantile honour were a good capital.&nbsp;
Their colossal fortunes and enduring fame prove that, to be
successful, men need not be mean, or false, or dishonest.&nbsp;
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>When John
Jacob Astor was a leading merchant in Now York, there were few
who could buy goods by the cargo.&nbsp; A large dealer in tea,
knowing that few merchants could outbid him, or purchase a cargo,
concluded to buy a whole shipload that had just arrived, and was
offered at auction.&nbsp; He had nobody to compete with, and he
expected to have everything his own way.&nbsp; Just before the
sale commenced, to his consternation he saw Mr. Astor walking
slowly down the wharf.&nbsp; He went to meet him, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Astor, I am sorry to meet you here this
morning; if you will go to your counting-room, and stay till
after the sale, I&rsquo;ll give you a thousand
dollars.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without thinking much about it, Mr. Astor
consented, turned on his heel, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Send round
the cheque.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lost money, but he kept his
word.&nbsp; When the lease for Astor House was nearly out, some
parties from Boston tried to hire it over the heads of the then
tenants.&nbsp; In a private interview with Mr. Astor, they wanted
to know his terms.&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;I will consult Mr.
Stetson (the tenant), and let you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; To do that
was, as they were well aware, to defeat the object they had in
view.&nbsp; The old New York merchant never gave a guarantee as
to the genuineness of the article he sold.&nbsp; It were needless
to ask it.</p>
<p>In New York, in Boston, and elsewhere, the rule of prosperity
is plain.&nbsp; One of the best-known presidents of a New York
bank began his career by blacking boots: he came to New York a
penniless lad, and sought employment at a store.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; said the merchant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can do anything,&rdquo; replied the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take these
boots and black them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did so, and he blacked them
well, and did everything else well.</p>
<p>Alexander Stewart (when alive, reputed to be the richest man
in the world) was born in Ireland, came young to New York, and,
with a little money that was left him by a relative in Ireland,
took a small shop.&nbsp; He kept in it from fourteen to eighteen
hours a day.&nbsp; He was his own errand-boy, porter,
book-keeper, and salesman.&nbsp; He lived over his store, and,
for a time, one room served as kitchen, bedroom, and
parlour.&nbsp; Mr. Stewart began business when merchants relied
on themselves, when banks gave little aid, when traders made
money out of their customers, not out of their creditors.&nbsp;
One day, while doing business in this <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>little store, a note became due which
he was unable to pay.&nbsp; The banks were unfriendly, and his
friends, as is always the case when you want to borrow, were
peculiarly hard up.&nbsp; Resolving not to be dishonoured, he met
the crisis boldly.&nbsp; He made up his mind never to be in such
a fix again.&nbsp; He marked every article in his shop below cost
price; he flooded the city with hand-hills; they were
everywhere&mdash;in basements, shops, steamboats, hotels, and
cars, promised everybody a bargain, and took New York by
storm.&nbsp; The little shop was crowded.&nbsp; Mr. Stewart
presided in person.&nbsp; He said but little, offered his goods,
and took the cash, all attempts to beat him down he quietly
pointed to the price plainly written on each package.&nbsp; He
had hardly time to eat or sleep; everyone came and bought, and
when they got home customers were delighted to find that they
were not cheated, but that they had secured a real bargain.&nbsp;
Long before the time named for closing the sale in the hand-bill,
the whole store was cleaned out, and every article sold for
cash.&nbsp; The troublesome note was paid, and a handsome balance
left over.&nbsp; For the future, he resolved to trade no more on
credit.&nbsp; The market was dull, times were bad, cash was
scarce; he would buy on his own terms the best of goods, and thus
he laid down the foundation of a fortune which, long before he
died, was reckoned at 30,000,000 dols. 1836, an American writer
thus described his mode of doing business:&mdash;&ldquo;Though
Mr. Stewart sells goods on credit, as do other merchants, he buys
solely for cash.&nbsp; If he takes a note, instead of getting it
discounted at a bank, he throws it into a safe and lets it
mature.&nbsp; It does not enter into his business, and the
non-payment of it does not disturb him.&nbsp; He selects the
style of carpet he wants, buys every yard made by the
manufacturer, and pays cash.&nbsp; He monopolises high-priced
laces, sells costly goods, furs, and gloves, and compels the
fashionable world to pay him tribute.&nbsp; Whether he sells a
first-rate or a fourth-rate article, the customer gets what he
bargained for.&nbsp; A lady on a journey, who passes a couple of
days in the city, can find every article that she wants for her
wardrobe at a reasonable price.&nbsp; She can have the goods made
up in any style, and sent to her house at a given hour, for the
opera or ball, or for travel.&nbsp; Mr. Stewart will take a
contract for the complete outfit of a steamship; furnish the
carpets, mirrors, chandeliers, china, silver-ware, cutlery, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>mattresses,
linen, blankets, napkins, with every article needed, in every
style demanded.&nbsp; He can defy competition.&nbsp; He buys from
the manufacturer at the lowest cash price; he presents the
original bills, charging only a small commission.&nbsp; The
parties have no trouble; the articles are of the first
class.&nbsp; They save from ten to twenty per cent., and the
small commission pays Stewart handsomely.&nbsp; He furnishes
hotels and churches in the same manner; as easily he could supply
the army and navy.&nbsp; He attends personally to his
business.&nbsp; He is down early, and remains late; those who
pass through the Broadway at the small hours may see the light
burning brightly from the working-room of the marble
palace.&nbsp; He remains till the day&rsquo;s work is done and
everything squared up.&nbsp; He knows what is in the store, and
not a package escapes his eye.&nbsp; He sells readily, without
consulting books, invoice, or salesmen.&nbsp; He has partners,
but they are partners only in the profits.&nbsp; He can buy and
sell as he will, and holds the absolute management of the concern
in his own hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who has not heard of the Harpers of New York, whose publishing
house in Franklin Square was, and it may be is, the largest of
the kind in the world; as they do all the business connected with
the publication of a book under one roof.&nbsp; In 1810, James
Harper left his rural home on Long Island, to become a
printer.&nbsp; His parents were devout Methodists.&nbsp; His
mother was a woman of rare gifts.&nbsp; She embraced him on his
departure, and bade him never forget the altar of his God, his
home, or that he had good blood in his veins.&nbsp; In his new
office all the mean and servile work was put upon the
printer&rsquo;s devil, as he was called.&nbsp; At that time
Franklin Square was inhabited by genteel people&mdash;wealthy
merchants; and poor James Harper&rsquo;s appearance attracted a
good deal of unpleasant comment.&nbsp; His clothes, made in the
old homestead, were coarse in material, and unfashionable in
cut.&nbsp; The young swells made fun of the poor lad.&nbsp; They
shouted to him across the streets&mdash;&ldquo;Did your coat come
from Paris?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Give us a card to your
tailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Jim, what did your mother give a yard
for your broadcloth?&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes, in their insolence,
the fellows came near, and, under pretence of feeling the
fineness of the cloth, would give an unpleasant nip.&nbsp; The
lad had a hard life of it; but he resolved not to be imposed
upon.&nbsp; One day, as he was doing some menial work, he was
attacked by one of his <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>tormentors, who asked him for his
card.&nbsp; He turned on his assailant, having deliberately set
down a pail that he was carrying, kicked him severely, and said,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my card; take good care of it.&nbsp; When I
am out of my time, and set up for myself, and you need
employment&mdash;as you will&mdash;come to me and I will give you
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Forty-one years after, when Mr. Harper&rsquo;s
establishment was known throughout all the land&mdash;after he
had borne the highest municipal honours of the city, and had
become one of the wealthiest men in New York&mdash;the person who
had received the card came to Mr. James Harper&rsquo;s
establishment, and asked for employment, claiming it on the
ground that he had kept the card given him forty-one years
before.&nbsp; With great fidelity James served out his
time.&nbsp; His master was pleased with him.&nbsp; In a
patronising way he told him, when he was free, he should never
want for employment.&nbsp; James rather surprised his old master
by informing him that he intended to set up for himself; that he
had already engaged to do a job, and that all he wanted was a
certificate from his master that he was worthy to be trusted with
a book.&nbsp; In a small room in Dover Street, James, and his
brother John, began their work as printers.&nbsp; Their first job
was 2,000 volumes of &ldquo;Seneca&rsquo;s Morals.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Their second book laid the foundation of their fortune.&nbsp; The
Harpers had agreed to stereotype an edition of the Prayer-book
for the Episcopal Society of New York.&nbsp; Stereotyping was in
a crude state, and the work was roughly done.&nbsp; When the
Harpers took the contract, they intended to have it done at some
one of the establishments in the city.&nbsp; They found that it
would cost them more than they were to receive.&nbsp; They
resolved to learn the art, and do the work themselves.&nbsp; It
was a slow and difficult labour, but it was accomplished.&nbsp;
It was pronounced the best piece of stereotyping ever seen in New
York.&nbsp; It put the firm at the head of the business.&nbsp; It
was found to be industrious, honourable, and reliable.&nbsp; In
six years it became the great printing-house of New York.&nbsp;
Other brothers joined the firm of Harper Brothers.&nbsp; Besides
personal attention to business, the brothers exercised great
economy in their personal and domestic expenses; one thousand
dollars was what it cost the brothers each to live for the first
ten years of their business life.&nbsp; As regarded their
<i>employ&eacute;s</i>, the utmost care was taken.&nbsp; The
liberal, genial, honourable spirit of the proprietors <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>prompted them
to pay the best wages, and secure the best talent.&nbsp; Those
who entered the house, seldom or never left it.&nbsp; Boys became
men, and remained there as <i>employ&eacute;s</i> all the
same.</p>
<p>In New York the love of Mammon finds no small place even in
sanctified breasts.&nbsp; The author of &ldquo;Sunshine and
Shade,&rdquo; in New York, says&mdash;&ldquo;Among the most
excited in the stock-market are men who profess to be
clergymen.&nbsp; One of this class realised a snug little fortune
of 80,000 dollars in his speculations.&nbsp; He did not want to
be known in the matter.&nbsp; Daily he laid his funds on the
broker&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp; If anything was realised it was taken
quietly away.&nbsp; The broker, tired of doing business on the
sly, advised the customer, if the thing was distasteful to him,
or he was ashamed openly to be in business, he had better retire
from Wall Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men of this class often have a
nominal charge.&nbsp; They affect to have some mission, for which
they collect money; they roam about among our benevolent
institutions, visit prisons or penitentiaries&mdash;wherever they
can get a chance to talk, to the great disgust of regular
missionaries, and the horror of superintendents.&nbsp; They can
be easily known by white cravats, sanctified looks, and the
peculiar unction of their whine.&nbsp; &ldquo;One man,&rdquo;
continues the writer in question, &ldquo;especially illustrates
the gentlemen of the cloth who are familiar with stocks.&nbsp;
His name appears in the Sunday notices as the minister of an
up-town church; down town he is known as a speculator.&nbsp; His
place of worship is a little house built in his yard.&nbsp; It is
not as long or as wide as the room in which he writes his
sermons.&nbsp; The pastor is a speculator; his church is his
capital, and on &rsquo;Change Rev. pays well.&nbsp; He has
controlled and abandoned half-a-dozen churches.&nbsp; He went
over to London, made a written contract with Mr. Spurgeon, the
celebrated preacher, by which the latter was to visit
America.&nbsp; It bound Spurgeon to give a certain number of
lectures in the principal cities of the land.&nbsp; Tickets were
to be issued to admit to the services.&nbsp; One-half of the
proceeds Spurgeon was to take with him to London to build his
tabernacle, the other half was to be left in the hands of the
gentleman who brought him over and engineered him through.&nbsp;
The contract, coming to light, produced a great commotion, and
Mr. Spurgeon declined to fulfil it.&nbsp; The war breaking <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>out, this
clerical gentleman tried his hand at a horse contract.&nbsp; He
approached a general of high position, and said he was a poor
minister, times were hard, and he wanted to make a little money;
would the general give him a contract?&nbsp; One was placed in
his hands for the purchase of a number of horses.&nbsp; The
minister sold the contract, and made a handsome thing of it; the
government was cheated.&nbsp; A committee of Congress, in looking
up frauds in the city, turned up this contract.&nbsp; In a report
to Congress, the general and the minister were mentioned in no
complimentary terms.&nbsp; While these transactions were going on
in New York, the general was in the field where the battle was
the thickest, maintaining the honour of the flag.&nbsp; The
report in which his name was dishonourably mentioned reached
him.&nbsp; His indignation was aroused.&nbsp; He sent a letter to
the speculating preacher, sharp as the point of his sword.&nbsp;
He told him if he did not clear him in every way from all
dishonourable connection in the transaction complained of, he
would shoot him in the street as soon as he returned to New
York.&nbsp; The frightened minister made haste to make the
demanded reparation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happily for the credit of
America, the author already referred to says, &ldquo;Such men are
held in as light esteem by the respectable clergy of the city,
and by the honourable men of their own denomination, as they are
by the speculators whom they attempt to imitate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a contrast to such contemptible men was John Jacob Astor,
who, at the age of twenty, left his German home, resolving to
seek a fortune in the New World.&nbsp; He was a poor uneducated
boy, and he trudged on foot from his home to the seaport whence
he was to sail.&nbsp; He was educated by his mother.&nbsp; His
school-books were his Bible and Prayer-book, and these he read
and pondered over to the last hour of his life.&nbsp; When he
left home, a small bundle contained all his worldly
possessions.&nbsp; He had money enough, for a common steerage
passage&mdash;that was all.&nbsp; He landed penniless on American
soil.&nbsp; As he left his native village, he paused and cast a
lingering, loving look behind.&nbsp; As he stood under the linden
tree he said, &ldquo;I will be honest; I will be industrious; I
will never gamble.&rdquo;&nbsp; He kept these resolutions till
the day of his death.&nbsp; He sailed from London for America in
1783.&nbsp; In the steerage he made the acquaintance of a
furrier, which was the means of his introduction to a business by
which he made millions.&nbsp; All sorts of stories are circulated
about the <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>early career of Mr. Astor.&nbsp; It was said that he
commenced by trading in apples and pea-nuts.&nbsp; He took with
him seven flutes, from his brother&rsquo;s manufactory in London;
these he sold, and invented the proceeds in furs.&nbsp; He went
steadily to work to learn the trade for himself: he was frugal,
industrious, and early exhibited great tact in trade.&nbsp; He
was accustomed to say, later in life, that the only hard step in
making his fortune was in the accumulation of the first thousand
dollars.&nbsp; He possessed marked executive ability.&nbsp; He
was quick in his perceptions.&nbsp; He came rapidly to his
conclusions.&nbsp; He made a bargain, or rejected it at
once.&nbsp; In his very earliest transactions he displayed the
same characteristics which marked him in maturer life.&nbsp; He
made distinct contracts, and adhered to them with inflexible
purpose.&nbsp; He founded the American Fur Company, in which he
had shares, and by means of which he amassed a fortune of over
50,000 dollars.&nbsp; His son succeeded in his father&rsquo;s
business, and in his father&rsquo;s ability for acquiring
money.&nbsp; His habits were very simple, and mode of life
uniform.</p>
<p>Next to Astor, perhaps, in America, we are most familiar with
the name of Commodore Vanderbilt, one of the self-made
millionaires of the city of New York.&nbsp; He began life a
penniless boy, and took to the water early.&nbsp; His first
adventure was rowing a boat from Staten Island to the city.&nbsp;
He took command of a North River steamboat when quite young, and
was distinguished at the start for his resolute, indomitable, and
daring will.&nbsp; He began his moneyed success by chartering
steamboats, and running opposition to all the old lines up the
North River, up the East River, up the
Connecticut&mdash;everywhere.&nbsp; Making a little money, he
invested it in stocks which were available in cash, and always
ready for a bargain.&nbsp; Honourable in trade, prompt, firm, and
reliable, he was decided in his business, and could drive as hard
a bargain as any man in the city.&nbsp; His custom was to conduct
his business on cash principles, and never to allow a Saturday
night to close without every man in his employ getting his
money.&nbsp; If anybody was about to fail, wanted money, had a
bargain to offer, he knew where to call.&nbsp; Nothing came
amiss&mdash;a load of timber, coal, or cordage, a cargo of a
ship, or a stock of goods in a factory, glass-ware, merchandise,
or clothing&mdash;the commodore was sure to find a <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>use for
them.&nbsp; A writer, in 1868, thus describes
him:&mdash;&ldquo;From nine to eleven the commodore is in his
up-town office; at one in his down-town office.&nbsp; Between
these hours he visits the Harlem and Hudson River stations.&nbsp;
He is now nearly eighty years of age.&nbsp; He it as erect as a
warrior; he is tall, very slim, genteel in his make-up, with a
fine presence, hair white as the driven snow, and comes up to
one&rsquo;s idea of a fine merchant of the olden time.&nbsp; He
is one of the shrewdest merchants, prompt and decided.&nbsp; In
one of the down-town mansions, where the aristocracy used to
reside, he has his place of business.&nbsp; He drives down
through Broadway in his buggy, drawn by his favourite horse,
celebrated for his white feet, one of the fleetest in the city,
and which no money can buy.&nbsp; His office consists of a single
room, quite large, well-furnished, and adorned with pictures of
favourite steamers and ferry-boats.&nbsp; The entrance to the
office is through a narrow hall-way, which is made an outer room
for his confidential clerk.&nbsp; He sees personally all who
call, rising to greet the comer, and seldom sits till the
business is discharged, and the visitor gone.&nbsp; But for this
he would be overrun and bored to death.&nbsp; His long connection
with steamboats and shipping brings to him men from all parts of
the world who have patents, inventions, and improvements, and who
wish his endorsement.&nbsp; II a man has anything to sell he
settles the contract in a very few words.&nbsp; The visitor
addresses the commodore, and says.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a stock of
goods for sale; what will you give?&rsquo;&nbsp; A half-dozen
sharp inquiries are made, and a price named.&nbsp; The seller
demurs, announcing that such a price would ruin him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want your goods.&nbsp; What did you come
here for if you did not want to sell?&nbsp; If you can get more
for your goods, go and get it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not a moment of time
will be lost, not a cent more be offered; and if the man leaves,
with the hope of getting a better price, and returns to take the
first offer, he will probably not sell the goods at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning from steamboats, Mr. Vanderbilt long ago became
interested in railroads.&nbsp; In this line, so great was his
success that he could control the market.&nbsp; &ldquo;An
attempt,&rdquo; says an American writer, &ldquo;was made some
time since to break him down by cornering the stock.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He wanted to consolidate the Harlem Road with the Hudson.&nbsp;
Enough of the legislature was supposed to have been secured to
carry the measure.&nbsp; <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>The parties who had agreed to pass
the bill intended to play foul.&nbsp; Besides this, they thought
they would indulge in a little railroad speculation.&nbsp; They
sold Harlem, to be delivered at a future day, right and
left.&nbsp; These men let their friends into the secret, and
allowed them to speculate.&nbsp; Clear on to Chicago, there was
hardly a railroad man who was not selling Harlem short.&nbsp; The
expected consolidation ran the stock up; the failure of the
project would, of course, run it down.&nbsp; A few days before
the vote was taken some friends called upon Commodore Vanderbilt,
and gave him proof that a conspiracy existed to ruin him, if
possible, in the matter of consolidation.&nbsp; He took all the
funds he could command, and, with the aid of his friends, bought
all the Harlem stock that could be found, and locked it up safe
in his desk.&nbsp; True to the report, the bill was
rejected.&nbsp; The men who had pledged themselves to vote for
it, openly and unblushingly voted against it.&nbsp; They waited
anxiously for the next morning, when they expected their fortunes
would be made by the fall of Harlem.&nbsp; But it did not
fall.&nbsp; To the surprise of everybody, the first day it
remained stationary; then it began to rise steadily, to the
consternation and terror of speculators.&nbsp; There was no stock
to be had at any price.&nbsp; Men were ruined on the right hand
and on the left.&nbsp; Fortunes were swept away, and the cry of
the wounded was heard up and down the Central Road.&nbsp; An
eminent railway man, near Albany, worth quite a pretty fortune,
who confidently expected to make 50,000 dollars by the operation,
became penniless.&nbsp; One of the sharpest and most successful
operators in New York lost over 200,000 dollars, which he refused
to pay on the ground of conspiracy.&nbsp; His name was
immediately stricken from the Stock board, which brought him to
his senses.&nbsp; He subsequently settled, but thousands were
ruined.&nbsp; Vanderbilt, however, made enough money out of this
attempt to ruin him, to pay for all the stock he owned in the
Harlem Road.&nbsp; Not satisfied with his achievements on the
land and on the American rivers, Mr. Vanderbilt resolved to try
the ocean.&nbsp; He built a fine steamer at his own cost, and
equipped her completely.&nbsp; The Collins line was then in its
glory.&nbsp; Mr. Collins, with his fine fleet of steamers, and
his subsidy from the government, was greatly elated, and very
imperious.&nbsp; It was quite difficult to approach him.&nbsp;
Any day, on the arrival of a steamer, he could be seen pacing <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>the deck, the
crowd falling back and making space for the head of the important
personage.&nbsp; One of his ships was lost; Vanderbilt applied to
Collins to allow his steamer to take the place vacant on the line
for a time; he promised to make no claim for the subsidy, and to
take off his ship as soon as Collins built one to take her
place.&nbsp; Collins refused to do this: he felt afraid if
Vanderbilt got his foot into this ocean business, he would get in
his whole body; if Vanderbilt could run an ocean-steamer without
subsidy, government would require Collins to do it; he saw only
mischief any way.&nbsp; He not only refused, but refused very
curtly.&nbsp; In the sharp Doric way that Vanderbilt had of
speaking when he is angry, he told Collins that he would run his
line off the ocean, if it took all of his own fortune and the
years of his life to do it.&nbsp; He commenced his opposition in
a manner that made it irresistible, and a work of short
duration.&nbsp; He offered the government to carry the mails, for
a term of years, without a dollar&rsquo;s cost to the nation; he
offered to bind himself, under the heaviest bonds the government
could exact, to perform this service for a term of years, more
promptly and faithfully than it had been ever done before.&nbsp;
His well-known business tact and energy were conceded.&nbsp; His
ability to do what he said, nobody could deny; his proposition
was not only laid before the members of Congress, but pressed
home by a hundred agencies that he employed.&nbsp; The subsidy
was withdrawn; Collins became a bankrupt; his splendid fleet of
steamers, the finest the world had ever seen, were moored at the
wharves, where they laid rotting.&nbsp; Had Collins conceded to
Vanderbilt&rsquo;s wishes, or divided with him the business on
the ocean, the Collins&rsquo; line not only would have been a
fact to-day, but would have been as prosperous as the Cunard
line.</p>
<p>When the rebellion broke out, the navy was in a feeble
condition; every ship in the south was pressed into the rebel
service.&nbsp; The men-of-war at Norfolk were burned.&nbsp; At
Annapolis they were mutilated and made unfit for service.&nbsp;
The efficient portion of the navy was cruising in foreign seas,
beyond recall.&nbsp; The need of ships of war and gun-boats was
painfully apparent.&nbsp; The steam-ship <i>Vanderbilt</i> was
the finest and fleetest vessel that ever floated in American
waters.&nbsp; Her owner fitted her up as a man-of-war at his own
expense, and fully equipped her.&nbsp; He then offered her for
sale to government at a reasonable price.&nbsp; Mr. Vanderbilt
found <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>that
there were certain men, standing between the government and the
purchase, who insisted on a profit on every vessel that the
government bought.&nbsp; He refused to pay the black-mail that
was exacted of him if his vessel became the property of the
nation.&nbsp; He was told that, unless he acceded to these
demands, he could not sell his ship.&nbsp; Detesting the conduct
of the men, who, pretending to be patriots, were making money out
of the necessities of the nation, he proceeded at once to
Washington, and presented the <i>Vanderbilt</i>, with all her
equipments, as a free gift to the nation.</p>
<p>There were few men who attended more closely to business than
the late Mr. Vanderbilt; and, as an American writer remarked of
him a few years before his death, &ldquo;financially he was ready
for the last great change.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that time his property
was estimated at about thirty millions of dollars.&nbsp; He was
very liberal where he took an interest; but very fitful in his
charities.&nbsp; He often not only subscribed liberally, but
compelled all his friends to do the same.&nbsp; He was prompt,
sharp, decisive in his manner of doing business; he was punctual
in his engagements to the minute; he was very intelligent and
well-informed, and, in commercial and national affairs, had no
rival in shrewdness and good judgment.&nbsp; He was affable,
assumed no airs, and was pleasant and genial as a companion; and
when time began to tell on his iron frame, and he began to feel
the decrepitude of age, he was not unmindful of its admonitions,
and entered into no new speculations; for he wished to leave no
unfinished business to his children, amongst whom his large
property&mdash;the results of favourable endeavour and successful
financial operations&mdash;was divided.</p>
<p>In the great cities of America&mdash;in such centres as
Chicago and New York&mdash;the men who make the most show of
wealth, who live in the finest houses, drive the best horses,
give the grandest parties, were many of them grooms, coachmen,
hotel porters, boot-blacks, news-boys, printers&rsquo; devils,
porters, and coal-heavers, who have risen from the lower walks of
life, and who left their respective homes, a few years ago, with
all their worldly wealth in the crown of their hat, or tied up in
a pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; They did the hard work of the
office, swept out the stores, made the fires, used the
marking-pot, were kicked and cuffed about, and suffered every
hardship.&nbsp; The men who made New York what it was were men of
the <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>old
school; they were celebrated for their courtesy and integrity;
they came from the humblest walks of life&mdash;from the plough
and anvil, from the lapstone and printing-case, from the farm and
quarry.&nbsp; They worked their way up, as Daniel worked his,
from the position of a slave to Prime Minister of Babylon.&nbsp;
Some of them went from their stores to compete with the ablest
statesmen in the world; they were the fathers and founders of the
American nation.&nbsp; These old schoolmen ate not a bit of idle
bread; they were content with their small store and pine-desk;
they owned their own goods, and were their own cashiers,
salesmen, clerks, and porters; they worked sixteen hours a day,
and so became millionaires.&nbsp; They would as soon have
committed forgery as be mean and unjust in trade; they made their
wealth in business, and not in fraudulent failures; they secured
their fortunes out of their customers, and not out of their
creditors.&mdash;Not so, Young America!&nbsp; An American writer
says:&mdash;&ldquo;He must make a dash.&nbsp; He begins with a
brown-stone store, filled with goods, for which he has paid
nothing; marries a dashing <i>belle</i>; delegates all the
business that he can to others; lives in style, and spends his
money before he gets it; keeps his fast horse, and other
appendages equally fast; is much at the club-room, and in
billiard or kindred saloons; speaks of his father as &lsquo;the
old governor,&rsquo; and of his mother as &lsquo;the old
woman;&rsquo; and, finally, becomes porter to his clerk, and
lackey to his salesman.&nbsp; Beginning where his father left
off, he leaves off where his father began.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us give a few more American illustrations of the way to
wealth, Boston has the honour of originating the express
companies of America.&nbsp; One morning a man took the East
Boston ferry, bound for Salem, over the Eastern Railroad.&nbsp;
He held in his hand a small trunk, trimmed with red morocco, and
fastened with red nails.&nbsp; The trunk contained a few notes
which the person was to collect; a small sum of money he was to
pay; and a few commissions he was to execute.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These,&rdquo; says an American newspaper, &ldquo;were the
tangible things in the trunk.&nbsp; Besides these notes, money,
and orders, that little trunk, which a child might have carried,
contained the germ of the express business of the land, whose
agencies, untiring as the sun, are almost as
regular.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alvin Adams&mdash;for that is and was the
name of the individual referred to&mdash;commenced the express
business, as an experiment, <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>between New York and Boston in
1840.&nbsp; He had no business, no customers, and no money.&nbsp;
He shrewdly saw the coming greatness of his calling, though for
one year it was carried on in the smallest possible way.&nbsp; He
had indomitable energy; his integrity was without a question; he
gained slowly on the confidence of the community, and closed the
year with a future of success before him.&nbsp; In 1854, the
business was transformed into a joint-stock company, and it now
stretches out its arms to all the towns and villages in the
land.&nbsp; It is an express company for merchandise, from a
bundle to a ship-load.&nbsp; The amount of money received and
disbursed every day exceeds that of any bank in the nation.&nbsp;
It collects and pays out the smallest sum, and from that to a
large waggon loaded with money, and drawn by three horses.&nbsp;
During the war, the company rendered efficient service to the
government: in time of peril or panic, when the property of the
army was abandoned or sacrificed, it bore away cart-loads of
money by its coolness and courage, and saved millions to the
Treasury.&nbsp; The company opened a department expressly to
carry money from the private soldiers to their families.&nbsp;
For a very small sum, funds were taken from the soldier and
delivered to his friends in any part of the land.&nbsp; On
several occasions, the transport department in the army being in
utter confusion, application was made to the Adams&rsquo; Express
Company for relief.</p>
<p>Jacob Little originated the dashing, daring style of business
in stocks, by which fortunes are made and lost in a single
day.&nbsp; In 1817, he came to New York, and entered the store of
Jacob Barker, who was at that time the shrewdest merchant in the
city.&nbsp; In 1822, he opened an office in a small basement in
Wall Street.&nbsp; Caution, self-reliance, integrity, and a
far-sightedness beyond his years, marked his early career.&nbsp;
For twelve years he worked in his little den as few men
work.&nbsp; His ambition was to hold the foremost place in Wall
Street.&nbsp; Eighteen hours a day he devoted to business; twelve
hours to his office.&nbsp; His evenings he spent in visiting
retail houses, to purchase uncurrent money; he executed all
orders committed to him with fidelity; he opened a correspondence
with leading bankers in all the principal cities from New York to
New Orleans.&nbsp; For twelve years Mr. Little was at the head of
his business; he was the Great Bear of Wall Street; his mode of
business enabled him to <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>accumulate an enormous fortune; and
he held on to his system till it beat him down, as it had done
many a strong man before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For more than a quarter of a century,&rdquo; writes the
author of &ldquo;Sunshine and Shadow,&rdquo; in New York,
&ldquo;Mr. Little&rsquo;s office, in the Old Exchange Buildings,
was the centre of daring gigantic speculations.&nbsp; On
&rsquo;Change his tread was that of a king.&nbsp; He could sway
and disturb the street when he pleased.&nbsp; He was rapid and
prompt in his dealings, and his purchases were usually made with
great judgment.&nbsp; He had unusual foresight, which, at times,
seemed to amount to defiance.&nbsp; He controlled so large an
amount of stock, that he was called the Napoleon of the
Board.&nbsp; When capitalists regarded railways with distrust, he
put himself at the head of the railroad movement.&nbsp; He
comprehended the profit to be derived from their
construction.&nbsp; In this way he rolled up an immense fortune,
and was known everywhere as the railway king.&nbsp; He was the
first to discover when the business was overdone, and immediately
changed his course.&nbsp; At the time the Erie was a favourite
stock, and selling at par, Mr. Little threw himself against the
street.&nbsp; He contracted to sell a large amount of this stock,
to be delivered at a future day.&nbsp; His rivals in Wall Street,
anxious to floor him, formed a combination.&nbsp; They took all
the contracts he offered; bought up all the new stock, and placed
everything out of Mr. Little&rsquo;s reach, making it, as they
thought, impossible for him to carry out his contracts.&nbsp; His
ruin seemed inevitable, as his rivals had both his contracts and
his stock.&nbsp; If Mr. Little saw the way out of his trouble, he
kept his own secrets; asked no advice; solicited no
accommodation.&nbsp; The morning dawned when the stock would have
to be delivered, or the Great Bear of Wall Street would have to
break.&nbsp; He came down to his office that morning,
self-reliant and calm, as usual.&nbsp; He said nothing about his
business or his prospects.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock he entered
the office of the Erie Company.&nbsp; He presented certain
certificates of indebtedness which had been issued by the
corporation.&nbsp; By those certificates the company had
covenanted to issue stock in exchange.&nbsp; That stock Mr.
Little demanded.&nbsp; Nothing could be done but to comply.&nbsp;
With that stock he met his contract, floored the conspirators,
and triumphed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reverses, so common to all who attempt the treacherous <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>sea of
speculation, at length overtook Mr. Little.&nbsp; Walking from
Wall Street with a friend one day, they passed through Union
Square, then the abode of the wealthiest people of New
York.&nbsp; Looking at the rows of elegant houses, Mr. Little
remarked&mdash;&ldquo;I have lost money enough to-day to buy the
whole square.&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and half the
people in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three times he became bankrupt; and
what was then regarded as a colossal fortune, was, in each
instance, swept away.&nbsp; From each failure he recovered, and
paid his debts in full.&nbsp; It was a common remark among the
capitalists, that &ldquo;Jacob Little&rsquo;s suspended papers
were better than the cheques of most men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole
man inspired confidence.&nbsp; He was retiring in his manner, and
quite diffident, except in business.&nbsp; He was generous as a
creditor.&nbsp; If a man could not meet his contracts, and Mr.
Little was satisfied that he was honest, he never pressed
him.&nbsp; After his first suspension, though legally free, he
paid every creditor in full, though it took nearly a million of
dollars.&nbsp; His charities were large and unostentatious.&nbsp;
The Southern rebellion, alas! swept away his remaining fortune,
and he died poor and resigned in the bosom of his family.&nbsp;
His last words were&mdash;&ldquo;I am going up.&nbsp; Who will go
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must not omit a name from this chapter, well known all the
world over&mdash;that of James Bennett, the founder of what is
still a power, the <i>New York Herald</i>.&nbsp; Scotland was the
birth-place of Bennett.&nbsp; He was reared under the shadow of
Gordon Castle.&nbsp; His parents were Roman Catholics, and he was
trained in their religion.&nbsp; Every Saturday night the family
assembled for religious service.&nbsp; James was kept at school
till he was fifteen years of age, and he then entered a Roman
Catholic seminary at Aberdeen, his parents intending him for the
ministry.&nbsp; He pursued his studies, on the banks of the Dee,
for three years, and then threw up his studies, and abandoned his
collegiate career.&nbsp; The memoirs of Benjamin Franklin
impressed him greatly, and he felt an earnest desire to visit
America, and the home of Franklin, and he landed there in
1819.&nbsp; At Portland he opened a school as teacher, and thence
he moved to Boston.&nbsp; He was charmed with all he saw in the
city and vicinity; he hunted up every memorial of Franklin that
could be found; he examined all the relics of the Revolution, and
visited the places made memorable in the struggle with Great
Britain; <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>but he was poor, and well-nigh discouraged.&nbsp; He
walked the common, without money, hungry, and without
friends.&nbsp; In his darkest hour he found a New York shilling,
and from that hour his fortune began to mend.&nbsp; He obtained a
position at Boston as proof reader, and displayed his ability as
a writer, both in prose and verse.&nbsp; In 1822, he came to New
York, and immediately connected himself with the press, for which
he had a decided taste.&nbsp; He was not dainty in his work; he
took everything that was offered him.&nbsp; He was industrious,
sober, frugal, of great tact, and displayed marked ability.&nbsp;
He soon obtained a position on the <i>Charleston Courier</i> as
translator of Spanish-American papers.&nbsp; He prepared other
articles for the <i>Courier</i>, many of which were in
verse.&nbsp; His style was sharp, racy, and energetic.&nbsp; In
1825, he became proprietor of the <i>New York Courier</i> by
purchase.&nbsp; It was a Sunday paper; but not a success.&nbsp;
In 1826, he became associate editor of the <i>National
Advocate</i>, a democratic paper.&nbsp; Leaving that, he became
associate editor of the <i>Inquirer</i>, conducted by Mr. Noah;
he was also a member of the Tammany Society, and a warm
partisan.&nbsp; During the session of Congress, Mr. Bennett was
at the capital writing for his paper; and while at that post, a
fusion was effected between the <i>Courier</i> and the
<i>Inquirer</i>.&nbsp; Again, he had to leave the paper on
account of a difference between him and the editor as regarded
the bank.&nbsp; At this time he turned his attention to the New
York press, which was then seriously behind the age.&nbsp; He
felt that it was not what was demanded, and resolved to establish
a paper that should realise his idea of a metropolitan
journal.&nbsp; He had no capital; no rich friends to back him;
nothing but his pluck, ability, and indomitable resolution.&nbsp;
On the 6th of May, 1835, the <i>New York Herald</i> made its
appearance.&nbsp; It was a small penny paper.&nbsp; Mr. Bennett
was editor, reporter, and correspondent; he collected the city
news, and wrote the money articles; he resolved to make the
financial feature of his paper a marked one; he owed nothing to
the Stock Board.&nbsp; If he was poor, he was not in debt; he did
not dabble in stocks; he had no interest in the bulls and bears;
he could pitch into the bankers and stock-jobbers as he pleased,
as he had no interest one way or the other.&nbsp; He worked hard,
he rose early, was temperate and frugal, and seemed to live only
for his paper.&nbsp; He was his own compositor and errand-boy;
collected <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>his own news, mailed his papers, kept his accounts, and
he grew rich.&nbsp; His marble palace was the most complete
newspaper establishment in the world.&nbsp; Before the
<i>Herald</i> buildings were completed, and while he was making a
savage attack on the national banks, he was waited upon by the
president of one of them, who said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
Bennett, we know that you are at great expense in erecting this
building, besides carrying on this immense business.&nbsp; If you
want any accommodation, you can have it at our bank.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Bennett replied&mdash;&ldquo;Before I purchased the land, or
began to build, I had, on deposit, 250,000 dollars in the
Chemical Bank.&nbsp; There is not a dollar due on the
<i>Herald</i> buildings that I cannot pay.&nbsp; I would pay off
the mortgage to-morrow if the mortgagee would allow me to.&nbsp;
When the building is open, I shall not owe a dollar to any man if
I am allowed to pay.&nbsp; I owe nothing that I cannot discharge
in an hour.&nbsp; I have not touched one dollar of the money on
deposit in the bank; and while that remains I need no
accommodation.&rdquo;&nbsp; One secret of his success is soon
told&mdash;&ldquo;He can command the best talent in the world for
his paper.&nbsp; He pays liberally for fresh news, of which he
has the exclusive use.&nbsp; If a pilot runs a steamer hard, or
an engineer puts extra speed on his locomotive, they know that
they will be well paid for it at the <i>Herald</i> office, for
its owner does not higgle about the price.&nbsp; When news of the
loss of Collins&rsquo; steamer was brought to the city, late on a
Saturday night, the messenger came direct to the <i>Herald</i>
office.&nbsp; The price demanded was paid; but the messenger was
feasted and confined in the building until the city was flooded
with extra Sunday morning copies.&nbsp; The
<i>attach&eacute;s</i> of the <i>Herald</i> are found in every
part of the civilised world; they take their way where heroes
fear to travel.&nbsp; If in anything they are outdone, outrun,
outwritten, if earlier and fresher news is allowed to appear, a
sharp, pungent letter is written, either discharging the writer,
or sending him home.&nbsp; During the war, the <i>Herald</i>
establishment at Washington was a curiosity.&nbsp; The place was
as busy as the War Department.&nbsp; Foaming horses came in from
all quarters, ridden by bespattered letter-carriers.&nbsp;
Saddled horses were tied in front of the door like the
head-quarters of a general.&nbsp; The wires were controlled to
convey the latest news from every section to the last moment of
the paper going to press.&nbsp; Mr. Bennett is a fine
illustration <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>(this was written, of course, in his lifetime) of what
America can do for a penniless boy, and what a penniless boy can
do for himself, if he has talent, pluck, character, and
industry.&nbsp; In the conflict of interest, and in the heat of
rivalry, it is difficult to estimate a man rightly.&nbsp; In
coming times, Mr. Bennett will take his place in that galaxy of
noble names who have achieved their own position, been architects
of their own fortune, and left an enduring mark upon the age in
which they lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace Greeley had an origin as humble, and a fight as hard as
Mr. Bennett.&nbsp; He was born in New Hampshire, and, from his
earliest years, was fond of study.&nbsp; The father had to move
to a new settlement; and here, as little was to be done at home,
after breakfast the home was left to take care of itself; away
went the family&mdash;father, mother, boys, girls, and
oxen&mdash;to work together.&nbsp; In early life the lad gave
proof that the Yankee element was strong in him.&nbsp; In the
first place, he was always doing something&mdash;and he had
always something to sell.&nbsp; He saved nuts, and exchanged
them, at the store, for the articles he wanted to purchase; he
would hack away, hours at a time, at a pitch-pine stump, the
roots of which are as inflammable as pitch itself, and, tying up
the roots in little bundles, and the little bundles into one
large one, he would take the load to the store, and sell it for
firewood.&nbsp; His favourite out-door sport, too, at Westhaven,
was bee-hunting, which is not only an agreeable and exciting
pastime, but occasionally rewards the hunter with a prodigious
mass of honey: as much as 150lbs. have frequently been obtained
from a single tree.&nbsp; This was profitable sport, and Horace
liked it amazingly; his share of the honey generally found its
way to the store.&nbsp; By these, and other expedients, the boy
always managed to have a little money.&nbsp; When he started, as
an apprentice, to learn the printing-trade, he packed up his
wardrobe in a small pocket-handkerchief&mdash;and, small as it
was, it would have held more&mdash;for the proprietor had never
more than two shirts and one change of clothing at the same time,
till he was of age.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ever there was a self-made
man,&rdquo; wrote an old friend, &ldquo;this same Horace Greeley
is one; for he had neither wealthy nor influential friends,
collegiate or academic education, or anything to aid him in the
world, save his own natural good sense, an unconquerable love of
study, and a determination to win his way by his own <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>efforts.&nbsp; He had, moreover, a natural aptitude for
arithmetical calculation, and could easily surpass, in his
boyhood, most persons of his age in the facility and accuracy of
his demonstrations and his knowledge of grammar.&nbsp; He early
learned to observe and remember political statistics, and the
leading men and measures of the political parties; the various
and multitudinous candidates for governor and Congress, not only
in a single State, but in many; and, finally, in all the States;
together with the taxation of, and vote of this and that, and the
other Congressional districts (why democrat and what not), at all
manner of elections.&nbsp; These things he rapidly and easily
mastered, and treasured in his capacious memory, till, we venture
to say, he has few, if any, equals at this time, in this
particular department, in this or any other country.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After Greeley had served his apprenticeship, he came to New York,
with ten dollars in his pocket, a bundle on his back, and a
stick.&nbsp; It was hard work for him to find a job; but, at
length, he was taken into a newspaper-office.&nbsp; After a time
he joined in a speculation which was to give New York a penny
paper; and, in conjunction with his partner, Mr. Story, went on
printing after the paper in question had ceased to exist.&nbsp;
He then started the <i>New Yorker</i>, having, in the meanwhile,
abandoned the use of stimulants, and become a vegetarian.&nbsp;
After more or less editorial work, more or less profitable,
Greeley started the <i>New York Tribune</i>, which, from the
first, was a success.</p>
<p>Another of New York&rsquo;s leading men was Daniel Drew.&nbsp;
His father died when he was fifteen years of age, and he came to
New York to seek his fortune.&nbsp; Resolved to do something, and
having nothing better to do, he became a soldier as a substitute
for another.&nbsp; Then he took to stock-keeping, and droves of
over 2,000 cattle crossed the Alleghanies under his
direction.&nbsp; In 1834, he began the steam-boat
enterprise.&nbsp; In 1836, he appeared in Wall Street.&nbsp; For
eleven years his firm was very celebrated.&nbsp; Mr. Drew was a
rapid, bold, and successful operator.&nbsp; His connection with
the Erie Railroad, guaranteeing the paper of that company to the
amount of a million and a-half of dollars, showed the magnitude
of his transactions.&nbsp; In 1857, as treasurer of the company,
his own paper, endorsed by Vanderbilt to the amount of a million
and a-half of dollars saved the Erie from bankruptcy.&nbsp;
During that year, amidst <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>universal ruin, Mr. Drew&rsquo;s
losses were immense; but he never flinched, met his paper
promptly, and said that, during all that crisis, he had not lost
one hour&rsquo;s sleep.&nbsp; In conjunction with Vanderbilt, he
relieved the Harlem Road from its floating debt, and replaced it
in a prosperous condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be unpardonable to forget the great
Barnum,&rdquo; says a New York writer, &ldquo;one of our most
remarkable men.&nbsp; He lives among the millionaires in a costly
brown-stone house in Fifth Avenue, corner of Thirty-ninth Street,
and is a millionaire himself.&nbsp; He has retired from the
details of actual life, though he has the controlling interest of
the Barnum and Van Amburgh Museum.&nbsp; He has made and lost
several fortunes; but, in the evening of life, he is in
possession of wealth, which he expends with great liberality and
a genial hospitality.&nbsp; He was born at Bethel, Connecticut,
and was trained in a village tavern kept by his father.&nbsp; He
had a hopeful buoyant disposition, and was distinguished by his
irrepressible love of fun.&nbsp; At the age of fifteen he began
life for himself, and married when he was nineteen.&nbsp; As
editor of the <i>Herald of Freedom</i>, he obtained an American
notoriety.&nbsp; The paper was distinguished for its pith and
vigour.&nbsp; Owing to sharp comments on officials, Mr. Barnum
was shut up in gaol.&nbsp; On the day of his liberation his
friends assembled in great force, with carriages, bands of music,
and flags, and carried him home.&nbsp; His first appearance as an
exhibitor was in connection with an old negress, Joyce Heth, the
reputed nurse of Washington.&nbsp; His next attempt was to obtain
possession of Scudder&rsquo;s American Museum.&nbsp; Barnum had
not five dollars in the world, nor did he pay any down.&nbsp; The
concern was little better than a corpse ready for burial, yet he
bound himself down by terms fearfully stringent, and met all the
conditions as they matured.&nbsp; He secured the person of
Charles S. Stretton, the celebrated dwarf, and exhibited
him.&nbsp; He also secured the services of Jenny land, binding
himself to pay her 1,000 dollars a-night for 150 nights, assuming
all expenses of every kind.&nbsp; The contract proved an immense
pecuniary success.&nbsp; From the days of Joyce Heth, to the
present time, Mr. Barnum has always had some speciality connected
with his show, which the world pronounces humbug; and Mr. Barnum
does not deny that they are so.&nbsp; Among these are the Woolly
Horse, the Buffalo Hunt, the Ploughing Elephant, the Segal
Mermaid, the <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>What-is-it, and the Gorilla.&nbsp; But Mr. Barnum claims
that, while these special features may not be all that the public
expect, every visitor to the exhibition gets the worth of his
money ten times over; that his million curiosities and
monstrosities, giants, and dwarfs, his menagerie and dramatic
entertainments, present a diversified and immense amount of
entertainment that cannot be secured anywhere else.&nbsp; A large
or red baboon, upon a recent occasion, was exhibited at the
Museum.&nbsp; It was advertised as a living gorilla, the only one
ever exhibited in America.&nbsp; Mr. Barnum&rsquo;s agents
succeeded in hoodwinking the press to such a degree, that the
respectable dailies described the ferocity of this formidable
gorilla, whose rage was represented to be so intense, and his
strength so fearful, that he was very near tearing to pieces the
persons who had brought him from the ship to the Museum.&nbsp;
Barnum had not seen the animal; and when he read the account in
the <i>Post</i>, he was very much excited, and sent immediately
to the men to be careful that no one was harmed.&nbsp; The baboon
was about as furious as a small-sized kitten.&nbsp; The story did
its work, and crowds came to see the wonderful beast.&nbsp; Among
others a professor came from the Smithsonian Institute; he
examined the animal, and then desired to see Mr. Barnum.&nbsp; He
informed the proprietor that he had read the wonderful accounts
of the gorilla, and had come to see him.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is a
very fine specimen of the baboon,&rsquo; said the professor;
&lsquo;but he is no gorilla.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the
reason that he is not a gorilla?&rsquo; said Barnum.&nbsp; The
professor replied, that &lsquo;ordinary gorillas had no
tails.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I own,&rsquo; said the showman,
&lsquo;that ordinary gorillas have no tails; but mine has, and
that makes the specimen the more remarkable.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
audacity of the reply completely overwhelmed the professor, and
he retired, leaving Mr. Barnum in possession of the field.&nbsp;
Mr. Barnum&rsquo;s rule has been to give all who patronise him
the worth of their money, without being particular as to the
means by which he attracts the crowds to his exhibitions.&nbsp;
His aim has been notoriety.&nbsp; He offered the Atlantic
Telegraph Company 5,000 dollars for the privilege of first
sending twenty words over the wires.&nbsp; It has not been all
sunshine with Mr. Barnum.&nbsp; His imposing villa at Bridgeport
was burned to the ground.&nbsp; Anxious to build up East
Bridgeport, he became responsible to a manufacturing company, and
his fortune was swept away in <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>an hour; but with wonderful sagacity
he relieved himself.&nbsp; As a business man, he has singular
executive force, and great capacity.&nbsp; Men who regard Mr.
Barnum as a charlatan, who attribute his success to what he calls
humbug, clap-trap, exaggerated pictures, and puffing
advertisements, will find that the secret of his success did not
lie in that direction.&nbsp; Under all his eccentricity, there
was a business energy, tact, perseverance, shrewdness, and
industry, without which, all his humbugging would have been
exerted in vain.&nbsp; From distributing Sear&rsquo;s Bible, he
became lessee of the Vauxhall Saloon; thence a writer of
advertisements for an amphitheatre at four dollars a-week; then
negotiating, without a dollar, for the Museum, which was utterly
worthless; outwitting a corporation who intended to outwit him on
the purchase of the Museum over his head; exhibiting a
manufactured mermaid which he had bought of a Boston showman;
palming off Tom Thumb as eleven years of age when he was but
five; showing his woolly horse, and exhibiting his wild buffaloes
at Holcken&mdash;these, and other small things that Barnum did,
are known to the public; but there are other things which the
public did not know.&nbsp; Barnum was thoroughly honest, and he
kept his business engagements to the letter.&nbsp; He adopted the
most rigid economy.&nbsp; Finding a hearty coadjutor in his wife,
he put his family on a short allowance, and shared himself in the
economy of the household.&nbsp; Six hundred dollars a-year he
allowed for the expenses of his family, and his wife resolutely
resolved to reduce that sum to 400 dollars.&nbsp; Six months
after the purchase of the Museum, the owner came into the
ticket-office at noon; Barnum was eating his frugal dinner, which
was spread before him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is this the way you eat your
dinner?&rsquo; the proprietor inquired.&nbsp; Barnum said,
&lsquo;I have not eaten a warm dinner since I bought the Museum,
except on the Sabbath, and I intend never to eat another on a
week-day till I am out of debt.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, you are
safe, and will pay for the Museum before the year is out,&rsquo;
replied the owner.&nbsp; In less than a year the Museum was paid
for out of the profits of the establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are no better rules for business success than those laid
down by Mr. Barnum, and which have guided his course.&nbsp; Among
them are these&mdash;&ldquo;Select the kind of business suited to
your temperament and inclination; let your pledged word <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>ever be
sacred; whatever you do, do with all your might; use no
description of intoxicating drinks; let hope predominate, but do
not be visionary; pursue one thing at a time; do not scatter your
powers; engage proper assistance; live within your income, if you
almost starve; depend upon yourself, and not upon
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the men who made most money by advertising, was
Mr. Barnes, the proprietor of the <i>New York Ledger</i>.&nbsp;
The manner was entirely his own.&nbsp; When he startled the
public by taking columns of a daily journal, or one entire side,
he secured the end he had in view.&nbsp; His method of repeating
three or four lines&mdash;such as, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Jenny Jones</span> writes only for the
<i>Ledger</i>!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Read Mrs. <span
class="smcap">Southwort&rsquo;s</span> new story in the
<i>Ledger</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;and this repeated over and over
again, till men turned from it in disgust, and did not conceal
their ill-temper&mdash;was a system of itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is the use,&rdquo; said a man to Mr. Barnes, &ldquo;of your
taking the whole side of the <i>Herald</i>, and repeating that
statement a thousand times?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you have
asked me that question,&rdquo; replied Mr. Barnes, &ldquo;if I
had inserted it but once?&nbsp; I put it in to attract your
attention, and to make you ask that question.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
mode of advertising was new, and it excited both astonishment and
ridicule.&nbsp; His ruin was predicted over and over again; and
when he had thus amassed a fine fortune, it was felt that the
position he had secured was the one he aimed at when he was a
mere printer&rsquo;s lad.&nbsp; He sought for no short paths to
success; he mastered his trade as a printer patiently and
perfectly; he earned his money before he spent it; in New York he
was preferred because he did his work better than others; he was
truthful, sober, honest, and industrious; if he took a job, he
finished it at the time and in the manner agreed upon.&nbsp; He
borrowed no money, incurred no debts, and suffered no
embarrassments.&nbsp; He was born in the north of Ireland, not
far from Londonderry, and was true to the Scotch Presbyterian
blood in his veins.</p>
<p>I now come to the most illustrious name, as regards
money-getters, either in England or America.&nbsp; Mr. George
Peabody was something more than a money-hunter, and, in the
history of money-making men, deserves the post of honour for his
philanthropy.&nbsp; He was born in Massachusetts, and was,
essentially, a self-taught and self-made man.&nbsp; After he had
learnt, in the district school, how to read and write, having <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>been four
years in a grocer&rsquo;s score, and having spent another year
with his grandfather in rustic life in Vermont, he went to join
his brother David, who had set up a drapery or dry-goods store at
Newburyport.&nbsp; This was stopped, a few months after, by a
fire, which destroyed Peabody&rsquo;s shop and most of the other
houses in the town.&nbsp; Fortunately, at this juncture, an
uncle, who had settled in George Town, in the district of
Columbia, invited young George to become his commercial
assistant; and he stayed with him a couple of years, managing the
most part of the business.&nbsp; In May, 1812, during the unhappy
war between Great Britain and America, when a British fleet came
up the Potomac, this young merchant&rsquo;s clerk, with others of
his time, volunteered into the patriot army, and served a few
months in the defence of Port Warburton, as a true citizen
soldier.&nbsp; The short war being over, his proved skill and
diligence brought him the offer of a partnership in a new
concern&mdash;it was that of Elisha Riggs, who was about to
commence the sale of dry goods throughout the middle States of
the Union.&nbsp; Riggs found the capital, while Peabody did the
work, and the firm at once achieved immense success.&nbsp;
Peabody acted as bagsman, and often travelled alone, on
horseback, through the western wilds of New York and
Pennsylvania, or the plantations of Maryland and Virginia, if not
farther, lodging with farmers or gentlemen slave-owners, and so
becoming acquainted with every class of people, and every way of
living: indeed, so fast did the Southern connection increase,
that the house was removed to Baltimore, though its branches were
established, seven years later, at Philadelphia and New
York.&nbsp; About the year 1830, Mr. Riggs having retired from
business, Mr. Peabody found himself at the head of one of the
largest mercantile firms in the home-trade of America.&nbsp; But
Mr. Peabody had also, by this time, distinguished himself as a
man of superior integrity, discretion, and public spirit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He coveted no political office; he courted the votes of no
party; he waited upon no caucus; put his foot down,&rdquo; says
the writer of the account of his life in the &ldquo;Annual
Register,&rdquo; &ldquo;upon no platform; but held aloof from the
strife of American factions.&rdquo;&nbsp; His first visit to
London was in 1827, whole he was still chief partner in the
Baltimore firm.&nbsp; In 1843, he fixed himself here, as merchant
and money-broker, with others, by the style of &ldquo;George
Peabody and Co., of Warnford <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Court, City.&rdquo;&nbsp; As one of
the three commissioners appointed by the State of Maryland to
obtain means for restoring its credit, he refused to be paid for
his services; but the State could not do less than vote him their
special thanks.&nbsp; To the last he retained his fondness for
his native land, and used to celebrate the anniversary of
American Independence, on the 4th of July, with a kind of public
dinner at the Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>It is as a magnificent giver as well as getter of money that
Mr. Peabody has become famous.&nbsp; He knew perfectly well what
he was about.&nbsp; He had seen as much of the world as most
elderly men of business accustomed to society and travel, and he
had come to the conclusion that a man was not made happy by fine
houses, and grand equipages, and stately parks, and galleries
filled with the choicest productions of art in ancient or modern
times, or by the social status which assuredly the possession of
money gives.&nbsp; None of these things, he found, made a man
happy; though if he had them, and were deprived of them, the loss
would make him truly unhappy indeed.&nbsp; Mr. Peabody thought he
knew a surer way to the possession of happiness; and that was, by
dedicating the wealth he had honourably acquired, to the
promotion of the well-being of his less fortunate fellow-men.</p>
<p>Some of his first acts of pecuniary munificence, as was to be
expected, had an American bearing.&nbsp; At the time of the Great
Exhibition of 1851, he promptly supplied the sum needed to pay
for the arrangements of the United States contributions.&nbsp; In
the following year he joined Mr. Henry Grinnell, of New York,
shipowner, in fitting out the expedition to the Arctic Sea in
search of Sir John Franklin.&nbsp; In the same year he bestowed a
large donation, since augmented to &pound;100,000, to found a
free library and educational institute at Danvers, his native
place.&nbsp; In 1857, he revisited his native land, after an
absence of twenty years.&nbsp; On this occasion he gave
&pound;100,000 to form, at Baltimore, a noble institute devoted
to science and art, in conjunction with a free public
library.&nbsp; The corner-stone of this building was laid in
1858, and the structure was then completed; but its opening was
delayed by the civil war which at that time prevailed.&nbsp; It
was not till after the conclusion of the war that it was finally
dedicated to the purposes for which it was founded.&nbsp; Mr.
Peabody afterwards gave a second &pound;100,000 to the
institute.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>In
1862, Mr. Peabody made the magnificent donation of &pound;150,000
for the amelioration of the condition of the poor of London, and
the trustees, who were men of mark and position, immediately
employed the money in accordance with the noble donor&rsquo;s
wishes, in the erection of model dwellings for working-men.&nbsp;
In 1866, he added another &pound;100,000 to the fund; and in
1868, he made a further donation of about fifteen acres of land
at Brixton, 5,642 shares in the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, and
&pound;5,405 in cash (altogether another &pound;100,000); thus
making the value of his gifts to the poor of London as much as
&pound;350,000.&nbsp; By the last will and testament of Mr.
Peabody, opened on the day of his funeral, his executors, Sir
Curtis Sampson and Sir Charles Reed, were directed to apply a
further sum of &pound;150,000 to the Peabody Fund, thus making a
sum of half a million sterling so employed.</p>
<p>This extraordinary beneficence, on the part of a private
citizen, was acknowledged in Great Britain.&nbsp; The freedom of
the City of London was conferred on Mr. Peabody by the
corporation.&nbsp; The Queen, not content with offering him
either a baronetcy or the Grand Cross of the Bath, which he
respectfully declined, wrote him a grateful letter, and invited
him to visit her at Windsor.&nbsp; In 1866, just before his
second visit to his native country, he received from her the gift
of a beautiful miniature portrait of herself, framed in the most
costly style, which he deposited in the Peabody Institute at
Danvers.&nbsp; The last token of public honour which was rendered
to Mr. Peabody before his death, was the uncovering, by the
Prince of Wales, of Storey&rsquo;s fine bronze statue of himself
behind the Royal Exchange.</p>
<p>Mr. Peabody remained in his native land three years, during
which time he largely increased the amount of his donations, and
founded more than one or two important institutions.&nbsp; He
gave 2,000,000 dollars for the education of the blacks and whites
in the South; 300,000 dollars for museums of American relics at
Yale and Harvard Colleges; 50,000 dollars for a free museum at
Salem; 25,000 dollars to Bishop McIlxame for Kenyon College; and
presented a sum of 230,000 dollars to the State of
Maryland.&nbsp; He also expended 100,000 dollars on a memorial
church to his mother, and distributed among the members of his
family 2,000,000 dollars.&nbsp; In recognition of his many large
gifts to public <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>institutions in America, Mr. Peabody received, in March
1867, a special vote of thanks from the United States.&nbsp; He
died in London, at the house of his friend, Six Curtis Sampson,
at Eaton Square, in the seventy-filth year of his age.&nbsp; The
funeral took place in Westminster Abbey though, in accordance
with the wishes of the deceased, the body was afterwards conveyed
to America.&nbsp; The coffin-lid bore the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

</blockquote>
<p>The late Mr. A. T. Stewart, dry-goods merchant of New York,
has left a curious monument of his administrative skill in the
great Working Women&rsquo;s Hotel, recently completed in that
city.&nbsp; As a large employer of labour, male as well as
female, Mr. Stewart became impressed with the difficulty that
working-folk have in finding lodgings even in comparatively new
cities.&nbsp; In swiftly-growing New York, the constantly
increasing demand for business premises has pushed the population
higher and higher up the island, until one fashionable street
after another has been converted into stores and offices, and
people fairly well off have built themselves handsome dwellings
further afield.&nbsp; This has been by no means an unprofitable
change for house-owners; for the compensation received for a
house &ldquo;down town,&rdquo; more than suffices to build and
furnish a handsome dwelling in that part of the city still
devoted to private residences; but to the poorer classes of
inhabitants, rapid change and development of this kind have been
not a little oppressive.&nbsp; Far more swiftly and suddenly than
in London, the working-people have found themselves thrust from
the space previously occupied by them, but grown too valuable to
be covered by their humble homes.&nbsp; Like their brethren in
London, they have either retired to the suburbs and find a
tiresome morning and evening journey added to the miseries of
life, or have taken refuge in large houses let out in tenements
and built expressly for the accommodation of artisan
families.&nbsp; Both English and American experiments in this
latter direction have been very successful.&nbsp; Practice has
taught the proper principle of constructing large <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>tenement
houses as well as artisans&rsquo; and labourers&rsquo; cottages,
and the working family is probably not less commodiously, and is
certainly more healthily, lodged than it has been at any
preceding period.&nbsp; The single man, too, is cared for; but
the single woman has hitherto been under certain
disadvantages.&nbsp; It is obvious that a house almost always
contains more space than she wants, and costs more money than she
can afford; and it is equally clear that in cooking her own meals
separately she is wasting time, food, and fuel.&nbsp; Some of
these objections might, perhaps, be got over by four or five
women clubbing together; but their general feeling has never been
strongly manifested in favour of divided rule or
responsibility.&nbsp; It is subjecting human nature to a severe
test to ask people to &ldquo;room together,&rdquo; as it is
called in America, the ordinary result being that the temporary
&ldquo;chums&rdquo; never speak again to each other for the rest
of their lives.&nbsp; It was to obviate this strain on human
sympathy that Mr. Stewart projected the Working Women&rsquo;s
Hotel, the completion of which he did not live to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging from the prices charged,&rdquo; says a writer
in the <i>Daily News</i>, &ldquo;and the regulations enforced,
the working women for whom the great hotel at New York has been
constructed, are of a class somewhat above that of the factory or
work-girl proper.&nbsp; Seven dollars a-week for board and a
separate room, or six dollars a-head if two persons occupy the
same room, is a price that would absorb an ordinary
workwoman&rsquo;s entire earnings.&nbsp; When it is recollected
that the value of a paper dollar is now within a fraction of that
of a gold one, and that wages and other things have fallen in
price with the contraction of the currency since the civil war,
it is not easy to see from what class of actual workwomen the
hotel is to draw its customers.&nbsp; Women working at trades
clearly cannot aspire to the comforts provided for seven dollars
a-week, and it is doubtful whether those in a position to pay
that sum will submit to the restrictions imposed upon
boarders.&nbsp; For the sum asked they can, at the present
moment, obtain board easily elsewhere, and enjoy perfect
liberty.&nbsp; It is very likely that the food and accommodation
provided at the hotel are much superior to those offered at the
smaller boarding-houses with which the outer edges of New York,
Brooklyn, and Jersey City are thickly studded; but mere eating
and sleeping seem to be regarded <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>by women, in America at least, in a
far less serious light than by men.&nbsp; The code of regulations
at the Working Women&rsquo;s Hotel affords an amusing instance of
the severity which comes over the American when called to the
lofty and important position of keeping an hotel.&nbsp; In other
walks of life he is easy and good-natured, but when impelled by
destiny to &lsquo;run&rsquo; an hotel, he undergoes a sudden
transformation into a despot.&nbsp; The guests at the new hotel
are informed that eight large parlours have been provided for the
reception of visitors, who will not be allowed in other rooms or
parlours except by express permission of the manager.&nbsp; The
eight parlours specified correspond, in fact, to the
strangers&rsquo; rooms at a club.&nbsp; It is furthermore
provided that no visiting to a room will be allowed except by
consent of all the occupants; that no washing of clothes will be
permitted in the rooms, and that no sewing-machines or working
apparatus shall be brought into them.&nbsp; This last regulation
may appear severe, but it is probably intended to protect those
who do not sew from annoyance.&nbsp; A sewing-machine is an
unpleasant neighbour, it is true; but so is a rocking-chair; yet
it may be doubted whether even the despot who reigns over this
last new &lsquo;institution&rsquo; will prove equal to the task
of tabooing that pestilent article of furniture.&nbsp; Animals
will be rigidly excluded.&nbsp; No dogs, cats, birds, or other
pet creatures will be suffered; meals will be served at fixed
hours; the gas will be turned off and the hotel closed at
half-past eleven.&nbsp; Whether this code will be submitted to by
American working-women capable of paying from 24<i>s.</i> to
28<i>s.</i> weekly for board and lodging remains to be
seen.&nbsp; The upper lady-clerk in a store is, as a rule, gifted
with great strength of character, and as a fairly educated,
self-reliant, and hardworking member of society, is perfectly
entitled to display her sense of independence.&nbsp; She will be
quick to perceive the advantages offered by the new hotel, but it
is at least probable that she will be equally quick to resent the
restrictions which it is sought to impose upon her sovereign will
and pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A poor rich man, not long since, died at Cincinnati, leaving
property worth considerably more than half a million
sterling.&nbsp; He lived up an alley in one small room, dressed
in rags, and looked like a penniless tramp, and yet he owned more
than 100,000 acres of land.&nbsp; Another citizen of Cincinnati
also offered to present to the city his valuable art-collection,
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>worth
&pound;40,000, on condition that a fire-proof building should be
erected in which to store it.</p>
<p>It is said that Peter Cooper, of New York, who has now (1878)
entered his eighty-eighth year, is worth &pound;2,000,000.&nbsp;
He began life as a coachmaker&rsquo;s apprentice; but having
invented a superior kind of glue, which came into general use, he
rapidly made an immense fortune.</p>
<p>The last illustration of getting on in America may be found in
the case of Carl Schurz, now (1878) one of the Secretaries of
State in America.</p>
<p>The history of Carl Schurz reads like a romance, for the
wandering Ulysses himself, restricted to narrower limits by the
imperfect geographical knowledge of his day, never had a tenth
part of his modern imitator&rsquo;s advantages in
&ldquo;observant straying&rdquo; over different lands, and amidst
diverse languages, nor &ldquo;noting the manners and their
climes&rdquo; of widely separated races.&nbsp; Born near Cologne
in 1829, and educated first at its gymnasium, and subsequently at
the University of Bonn, Carl Schurz enjoyed superior educational
advantages, by which, naturally studious, he greatly
profited.&nbsp; When but nineteen years of age, under the
influence of his professor, Kinkel, he became a Revolutionist in
his sentiments; and in the year 1848, memorable for the
revolutionary tide that swept over Europe, established, in
conjunction with his professor, a journal to advocate those
principles.&nbsp; Of this journal he was for a time sole
editor.&nbsp; When, in, the spring of 1849, the abortive
insurrectionary effort was made at Bonn, in which both he and the
professor took a part, they fled together to the
Palatinate.&nbsp; Here our young student joined the revolutionary
army as adjutant, and aided in the defence of Rastadt against the
government troops.&nbsp; On the surrender of that place he
escaped to Switzerland, but soon returned to deliver his friend
Professor Kinkel from the fortress of Spandau.&nbsp; In this
effort he was successful.&nbsp; In 1851, we find the young
revolutionist at Paris, as correspondent of German journals, and
a little later at London, for a year giving lessons in
German.&nbsp; But the exile wearied of Europe, and his fancy
drove him to America, where he arrived ignorant of the language,
and, it is to be presumed, short of cash.&nbsp; But he proceeded
to grapple resolutely with both difficulties.&nbsp; Three years
he spent in the quiet Quaker city of Philadelphia, teaching, and
learning, <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>and writing&mdash;for there is a large German population
In Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Then he drifted westwards; first to
Wisconsin, where he commenced his career as a political partisan
making speeches in German, during the presidential canvass of
1856, on the Republican side.&nbsp; He was also an unsuccessful
candidate for the lieutenant-governorship of Wisconsin that
year&mdash;fast work for one but four years in the country.&nbsp;
The first public speech he delivered in the English language was
in 1858, about which time he commenced the practice of law.&nbsp;
In 1859, he made a lecture tour through the New England States,
speaking English, as I have been informed by an auditor, very
imperfectly.&nbsp; Now he speaks the language with perfect
purity, and a scarcely perceptible accent.&nbsp; In 1860, he was
an influential member of the National Republican Convention, and
one of the chief speakers during the canvass that resulted in the
election of Lincoln to the presidency.&nbsp; Appointed by Mr.
Lincoln minister to Spain, he soon resigned that office to return
home and take part in the civil war&mdash;the Germans forming a
large portion of the military contingent in the Federal army, the
great bulk of the German immigration having settled in the North
and North-western States; very few indeed at the South.&nbsp; It
was a curious sequel to a revolutionary career at home that Mr.
Schurz should have been so soon engaged in suppressing a
rebellion in his adopted country.&nbsp; He rose to the rank of
major-general in the Federal service, and took part in the battle
of the second Bull Run, and where Stonewall Jackson defeated the
Federals at Chancellorsville.&nbsp; He was also at Chattanooga
and Gettysburg fights.&nbsp; At the close of the war he returned
to the practice of the law, and connected himself with the
newspaper press in different parts of the country as a Washington
correspondent.</p>
<p>When, in 1866, after the assassination of President Lincoln,
Andrew Johnson was acting President of the United States, he
appointed Carl Schurz as special commissioner to visit and report
on the actual condition of the southern country, then under
process of reconstruction.&nbsp; On his return from this mission
our German Ulysses migrated to Detroit in Michigan, where he
founded a newspaper.&nbsp; The ensuing year he moved again to the
city of St. Louis, in Missouri, where he founded a German
newspaper, took an active part for General Grant in both
languages in 1868, <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>and in 1869 was elected United States senator for six
years&rsquo; term from Missouri.&nbsp; Disagreeing with General
Grant&rsquo;s policy and mode of conducting public affairs, Mr.
Schurz passed over to the Opposition to his administration, and,
in conjunction with Horace Greeley&mdash;like himself an
Abolitionist and Republican&mdash;sought to establish a reform
party of Liberal Republicans, as opposed to the Spoils party of
Grant.&nbsp; Mr. Schurz was the presiding officer in the
Cincinnati Republican Convention, which nominated Horace Greeley
for the presidency, and since then his career has been one of
unmitigated success.</p>
<p>In the new States, as well as in the old, these American
money-makers flourish.&nbsp; As I write, I hear that Mark
Hopkins, the great Californian railway millionaire, has died with
upwards of &pound;3,000,000, and his will cannot be found.&nbsp;
In the absence of a will his widow takes two-thirds of the
fortune, and his two brothers the remainder.&nbsp; Money-making,
it may be said, is the chief characteristic of Brother Jonathan
and his numerous and pushing tribe.</p>

68</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHARLES BIANCONI, THE IRISH
CAR-MAN</span>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life of a self-made man is at
all times a deeply interesting study.&nbsp; We like to see how he
mastered surrounding circumstances, with what bravery he met
adverse fate, and how he fared when he had triumphed and become
strong.&nbsp; Such a man is not always a model to be held up for
admiration.&nbsp; Often there is a hardness and coarseness about
him which is undesirable, and an assumption of greatness on
account of pecuniary success, which, in good society at any rate,
will be resented.&nbsp; When the late Mr. Peabody was honoured
with a statue under the shadow of the Royal Exchange, and within
the heart of the City, it was said by some ill-natured Yankee,
that if England wished to erect statues to such men, there were
plenty of rich men America could supply us with for that purpose;
and certainly it is not in the true interests of humanity that we
should get into the habit of paying too much homage to
worshippers of the Golden Calf.&nbsp; Undoubtedly it will be much
to be deprecated if that be the worship of the future; but it is
a danger in these levelling days, when democracy is coming more
and more to the front, against which the preacher and the
moralist must ever guard the nation.&nbsp; At all times the tone
of public thought must be pitched low, and when rank has lost its
<i>prestige</i>, the danger of being swamped by vulgar plutocrats
is immensely increased.&nbsp; As was to be expected, Mrs.
O&rsquo;Connell is very proud of her father, and, as was also to
be expected, the father was very proud of himself.&nbsp; He was a
very illiterate man.&nbsp; He even could not spell the word money
properly; but no man knew better what it meant, and no man could
have ever anticipated that he would have secured so much of it as
he did.&nbsp; As a boy he had the reputation of being stupid, and
also wild; and <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>it seems to have been with the view of getting rid of
him that his father sent him from his home in the Lombard
Highlands, in company with one Andrea Faroni, to England, where
he was to learn to become a dealer in prints, barometers, and
eye-glasses.&nbsp; It was a fortunate thing for Charles Bianconi
that Favoni brought him instead to Ireland.&nbsp; In
London&mdash;the great cold world of London&mdash;it would have
fared hard with the poor Italian lad.&nbsp; In Dublin and the
country round, the good-looking foreigner, with his bright eyes
and his civil tongue, met with a warm reception&mdash;a reception
all the more warm, inasmuch as he was of the Irish faith; but
even then it is strange how he prospered as he did.&nbsp; Without
knowing a word of the language, and with fourpence in his pocket
to pay expenses, he was sent out into the country on the Monday
morning with two pounds&rsquo; worth of prints to sell, and with
the understanding that he was to be back by Saturday night; but
the lad had made up his mind to be a somebody, and he was as good
as his word; and he had not been long in Ireland before he hit on
the idea which led him to fame and fortune.</p>
<p>One of his first lessons in Ireland was, he tells us, the
great difference between the pedlar doomed to tramp on foot, and
his more fortunate fellow who could post or ride on
horseback.&nbsp; When he became a small shopkeeper at Carrick,
the need of equestrian conveyance was brought home to him in a
still more forcible manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;I supplied,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;my Carrick shop with gold-leaf from Waterford,
going down in Tom Mahony&rsquo;s boat to buy it.&nbsp;
Carrick-on-Suir is twelve or thirteen miles from Waterford by
land, but the windings of the river make it twenty-four by
water.&nbsp; This boat, then, was the only public
conveyance.&nbsp; The time of its departure had to depend upon
the tide, and it took four or five hours to make the
journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; One day, going to Waterford by the boat,
Bianconi got sodden with the wet, and was laid up with cold and
pleurisy for a couple of months.&nbsp; This Irish experience was
putting him in the right track; and in 1815, when good horses
were to be had cheap, in consequence of the peace, he had the
courage to start his cars, running at first between Carrick and
Clonmel, a distance of some twelve miles.&nbsp; At first Bianconi
only contemplated carrying the poorer people.&nbsp; There was the
aristocratic mail-coach for the people of quality; but greatness
was thrust upon him.&nbsp; <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>In 1830 he carried the mails direct
from the post-office, and had bought up some leading coaching
lines.&nbsp; In his latter years he had 1,400 horses at work, and
daily covered 3,800 miles.&nbsp; Still further, to give the
reader an idea of the extent of his business, we may note there
were 140 stations for the change of horses, and that these latter
consumed from 3,000 to 4,000 tons of hay, and from 30,000 to
40,000 barrels of oats annually.&nbsp; In England Bianconi could
never have made his fortune in this way.&nbsp; In Ireland he
appeared at the right time, and was the right man in the right
place.</p>
<p>As a benefactor to Ireland it is almost impossible to
overestimate Bianconi&rsquo;s usefulness.&nbsp; The farmer who
formerly drove spent three days in making his market; when the
cars came into operation one day was sufficient, thereby saving
two clear days and expense of his horse.&nbsp; Another good
object gained was the opening up the resources of the interior of
the country.&nbsp; And lastly, there was the civilising effects
of the intercommunion created among classes of the country, by
means of travelling together on one or other of the Bianconi
cars.&nbsp; The way in which the system was organised ensured its
success, &ldquo;I take my drivers,&rdquo; said Mr. Bianconi at
the Cork meeting of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, &ldquo;from the lowest grade of the
establishment.&nbsp; They are progressively advanced, according
to their respective merits, as opportunity offers, and they know
that nothing can deprive them of these rewards, and also of a
pension of their full wages in cases of old age or accident,
unless it be their own wilful and improper conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The whole establishment must have had a beneficial influence over
a large area.&nbsp; Any man found guilty of uttering a falsehood,
however venial, was instantly dismissed, and this consequently
insured truth, accuracy, and punctuality.&nbsp; It must be
remembered, too, at the time in which Mr. Bianconi commenced his
career, the county of Tipperary was much disorganised, owing to
the maladministration of the laws, and to the almost total
severance of the bond which ought to have united the upper and
humble classes of society.&nbsp; At that time the Catholics were
generally looked down upon as beings of an inferior race.&nbsp; A
Catholic was not permitted to buy or become possessed of
land.&nbsp; In his very short autobiography, Mr. Bianconi thus
describes the grievances of the Roman Catholics:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One of the injustices of which the
Catholics used to tell <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>me, was the unfair way in which the
Catholics were treated in Clonmel.&nbsp; Amongst others, they
relate a practice then in existence.&nbsp; The Protestant
shopkeepers, upon a certain day, used to go about the town
levying a tax upon their Catholic neighbours who attempted to
open shops within the town walls of Clonmel.&nbsp; They used to
wring from each individual from two to four guineas, which they
called intrusion money.&nbsp; My informants especially praised an
old Mrs. Ryan, now dead, who boldly refused to comply with their
demands.&nbsp; The tax-makers, therefore, seized her goods.&nbsp;
She afterwards recovered them at law, and her spirited conduct
led to the abolition of this toll.&nbsp; We Catholics had at one
time to pay a tax upon all bought merchandise, while our more
favoured Protestant and Dissenting fellow-townsmen were saved not
only from a needless expenditure, but from the galling contact
with such a class as the toll-gatherers.&nbsp; In the house, 112,
Main Street, was the news-room, which I joined.&nbsp; I was
greatly struck by the loud and consequential talk constantly
going on between a Mr. Jephson and a Sir Richard Jones, and two
more of their set, whereas I and my fellow-Papists were not
allowed to speak above a whisper.&nbsp; This I resolved not to
submit to; for I could see no reason why, when I had paid my
money in a public place, I should not share all equal
rights.&nbsp; Others followed my example; and as we all,
Protestants and Papists, indulged in equally noisy declamation, a
stranger entering our news-room would have been puzzled to say
which party were the privileged administrators of the penal
code.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irish like, Mr. Bianconi managed now and then to have his
joke.&nbsp; One day, when he was sending home in a large wooden
case a very superior looking-glass, an old lady asked what was in
the box thus carefully conveyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Repeal of the
Union,&rdquo; was Bianconi&rsquo;s reply.&nbsp; The old
woman&rsquo;s delight and astonishment knew no bounds.&nbsp; She
knelt down on her knees in the middle of the road, to thank God
for having preserved her so long, that at last, in her old days,
she should have seen the Repeal of the Union.&nbsp; As another
illustration, we quote the story of the opposition
car:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His first attempt he thought was going to
be a failure; scarcely anybody went by car.&nbsp; People were
used to trudging along on foot, and they continued to do, thus
saving their money, which was more valuable than their
time.&nbsp; Another <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>man would have abandoned the speculation; but Mr.
Bianconi did nothing of the kind.&nbsp; He started an opposition
car, at a cheaper rate, which was not known to be his&mdash;not
even by the rival drivers, who raced against each other for the
foremost place.&nbsp; The excitement of the contest, the
cheapness of the fare, the occasional free lifts given to
passengers, soon began to attract a paying public, and before
very long both the cars every day came in full.&nbsp; He had
bought a great, strong, yellow horse, as he called him, to run in
the opposition car; he gave, he said, &pound;20 for the
animal.&nbsp; One evening his own recognised driver came to him
in great pride and excitement.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know the great,
big, yallah horse under the opposition car?&nbsp; Well, sir,
he&rsquo;ll never run another yard.&nbsp; I broke his heart this
night.&nbsp; I raced him from beyant Moore-o&rsquo;-Barns, and
he&rsquo;ll never thravel agin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bianconi told me
he was obliged to show the greatest gratification at the loss of
his beast; but it gave him enough of the opposition car, which
there and then came to an end, like the poor horse.&nbsp; The
habit of travelling on a car increased among a people when they
had become alive to its advantage.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main principle on which Bianconi acted was never to
despise poor people, or apparently small interests.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His great enterprise,&rdquo; wrote Dr. Cook Taylor,
&ldquo;arose from the problems, how to make a two-wheeled car pay
while running for the accommodation of poor districts and poor
people, as regularly as the mail-coaches did for the rich; and
when that was solved, how to regulate a system of traffic by a
network of cars, the cars increasing in size as the traffic
required, from the short one-horse car, holding six people, to
the long four-horse car, holding twenty people.&rdquo;&nbsp; One
extract more will give the reader Mr. Bianconi&rsquo;s secret of
money-making:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I remember when I was earning a shilling a
day in Clonmel, I used to live upon eightpence, and that did not
prevent the people from making me their mayor.&nbsp; I did the
same at Cashel and at Thurles, and that does not prevent me from

<p>&ldquo;It gives me sincere pleasure in seeing you follow the
sound principle of having your wants within your means.&nbsp;

<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Mrs.
O&rsquo;Connell writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I may add, as a postscript, what my father
once said to a young Yorkshireman, &lsquo;Keep before the wheels,
young man, or they will run over you.&nbsp; Always keep before
the wheels.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his way, Mr. Bianconi was a religious man.&nbsp; He and his
priest were always on good terms.&nbsp; He did not run his cars
on a Sunday, because the Irish, being a religious people, will
not travel for business on that day.&nbsp; He also found his
horses worked better for one day&rsquo;s rest in seven.&nbsp;
With Daniel O&rsquo;Connell he was on the most intimate terms,
and Sheil was often a guest at his house.&nbsp; He was an
out-and-out Liberal, and always maintained that when the Tory
landlords saw that they would fail to get one of their own party
into parliament, they encouraged their tenants to vote for the
Home Rule nominee, in the hope of balking the steady-going
Liberal who could afford to be honest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
known,&rdquo; writes Mrs. O&rsquo;Connell, &ldquo;a great
Protestant land-owner boast of having given tacit support to the
ultra-Liberal candidate, in the pious hope that he could thereby
cause mischief in the Liberal benches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not pleasant to read that Bianconi, true friend to
Ireland as he was, narrowly escaped the penalty too generally
attached to ownership of land in Ireland.&nbsp; It was said that
he was marked out to be shot!&mdash;it was even thought that the
deed had been planned and attempted, and frustrated only by the
parish priest, who asked him to take a seat in his gig on his way
home from Cashel.&nbsp; Bianconi had driven in from Longfield in
his own carriage, but he accepted the priest&rsquo;s invitation
and went back with him.&nbsp; It seems there are two roads
leading from Cashel towards Longfield House, and the priest chose
the longer of the two.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you take this
road?&rdquo; said Bianconi.&nbsp; &ldquo;I prefer it,&rdquo;
replied the priest, and nothing more was said about it then; but
it was suspected that the old priest had heard something, or got
some warning, for it afterwards became known that a party of men
had that night been watching on the other road.&nbsp; Happily for
the credit of Ireland, Bianconi expired peacefully in 1873, at a
ripe old age, as is manifest when we state that he was born in
1786.&nbsp; One of his last acts was characteristic.&nbsp; Struck
with paralysis, he discovered, about a week before his death an
error of eightpence in the deduction for poor-rates out of a
large rent cheque.&nbsp; Verily, of such is the kingdom <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>of
Mammon.&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Connell, however, has done her best to
make her father&rsquo;s memory fragrant; but she is a novice in
the art of book-making, and we must take the will for the
deed.&nbsp; Let us hope her countrymen will study the example she
holds out to them of a man industrious, and careful, and
economical, and eager for the main chance.&nbsp; It is such men
Ireland needs far more than agitators for Home Rule.&nbsp; In the
colonies no one learns more readily the value of thrift than the
Irishman, or gives us a finer example of how to reap the golden
harvest which it ensures; but in his native land the Irishman
loves more to spend money than earn it.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Dargan,
the great railway contractor, was, however, one of those
exceptions which teach us how, even in his native land, the
poorest Irishman may amass a fortune.&nbsp; Young Dargan received
a good education, and after leaving school was placed in a
surveyor&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; With little beyond this training,
and a character for the strictest integrity, he left Ireland to
push his fortunes.&nbsp; His first employment was under Telford,
who was then engaged in constructing the Holyhead Road.&nbsp;
When this was completed Dargan returned to Ireland, and embarked
in several minor undertakings, in which he was fortunate enough
to gain sufficient to form the nucleus of that princely fortune
which entitled him to the appellation of a millionaire.&nbsp;
After the highly successful result of the Great Exhibition of
1851, Mr. Dargan, with the view of developing the industrial
resources of his native country, and with a munificence certainly
without parallel in one who had been &ldquo;the architect of his
own fortune,&rdquo; resolved on founding an Industrial Exhibition
in Dublin, and placed &pound;20,000 in the hands of a committee,
consisting of the leading citizens, and empowered them to erect a
building, and to defray all the necessary expenses connected with
the undertaking, on the sole condition that no begging-box should
be handed found for further contributions.&nbsp; He undertook,
moreover, to advance whatever additional sums might be required
to carry the enterprise to a successful issue.&nbsp; In fact,
before the Exhibition opened (May 12, 1853), Mr. Dargan&rsquo;s
advances are said not to have fallen far short of
&pound;100,000.</p>

75</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A FORTUNE MADE BY A
VEGETARIAN.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> one of the most remarkable
cases of success in life is the following, as described by Mr.
Napier, of Merchiston, in a paper in &ldquo;Fraser&rsquo;s
Magazine.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After the reading of my paper on the
vegetarian core for intemperance, before the Bristol Meeting of
the British Association in 1875, I was addressed by an elderly
gentleman and his wife, who said my views were strictly in
accordance with theirs.&nbsp; After some conversation, we
adjourned to his hotel, where he hospitably entertained me, and
gave me a narrative of his life, with permission to publish it in
the interest of the good cause, suppressing his name and abode,
as he said he was particularly shy and retired in his habits, and
had a great objection to see his name in print.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was born in the north of England in 1811; but
although his hair was grey, he otherwise appeared better
preserved by fifteen years than most persons of his age.&nbsp;
His father was a minister of religion, and he was the eldest of
twelve children.&nbsp; He was of ancient and distinguished
lineage; but his father never having had more than &pound;300
a-year, he was obliged to send his children out early into the
world, and so at fourteen he was put into a house of business in
a great northern town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first three years he had nothing but his board
with one of the senior clerks; but at the end of that time he got
as much dry bread and water for his lunch as he could take, and
ten shilling a a-week to board and lodge himself.&nbsp; He
accidentally obtained some works on vegetarianism, and was
resolved to put in practice what he had read, as otherwise he
found he could not support and clothe himself decently.&nbsp; I
will give now his own words as nearly as I can recollect.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was seventeen years of age then, five
feet eight inches high, and strongly built.&nbsp; I had but ten
shillings a-week for everything.&nbsp; How should I best lay it
out?&nbsp; The senior clerk took me as a lodger at eighteenpence
a-week, for one good room.&nbsp; There was a bedstead in it, but
no bedding or other furniture.&nbsp; I was resolved to do what
best I could, and owe no man anything.&nbsp; Some canvas
coverings, which my good mother had put round my packages, served
me to make a mattress when filled with hay.&nbsp; For the first
eight weeks I slept in my oldest clothes on this mattress.&nbsp;
My diet was ample and nourishing, but very cheap.&nbsp;
Threepence a-day was the cost.&nbsp; About one pound of beans,
which did not cost more than a penny, half a pound of bread
daily, and two halfpenny cabbages, and three pounds of potatoes
in the week.&nbsp; Two-pennyworth of seed oil, <a
name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a"
class="citation">[76a]</a> one pound of twopenny rice, and about
a farthing&rsquo;s worth of tartar <a name="citation76b"></a><a
href="#footnote76b" class="citation">[76b]</a> from the wine
casks, constituted my very nourishing diet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When my parents sent me a basket of fruit, I
indulged in it freely; but I did not care for it unless the
carriage was paid, which was not always the case.&nbsp; Thus
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> for my food and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for
my lodging, and 9&frac12;<i>d.</i> for my fuel and light, left me
5s. 11&frac12;<i>d.</i> for other purposes.&nbsp; At the end of
the eight weeks I have specified, I was in possession of above
&pound;2.&nbsp; It took me nearly this sum to purchase a straw
paillasse, blankets, sheets, and pillows second-hand.&nbsp; I
persevered for another year on this diet, and found myself in
possession of about &pound;12.&nbsp; As I had some respectable
acquaintance in the town, I resolved on spending this sum in
furniture, in order that I might have a decent room into which to
ask my visitors.&nbsp; Taking a lesson from the poet Goldsmith, I
had &lsquo;a bed by night&mdash;a chest of drawers by day,&rsquo;
so that my apartment, alternately sitting-room and bedroom, was
suitable for lady visitors.&nbsp; I often invited the lady you
see sitting opposite to you, to take tea on Sunday with me and
then go to church.&nbsp; She was my own age exactly, and was the
prey of a cruel stepmother; she was, in fact, a sort of
Cinderella in a large family.&nbsp; Her stepmother aimed at
marrying <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>her to a widower of forty-five, with seven children; but
this my young girl of eighteen objected to.&nbsp; Her father at
first sanctioned our engagement; but when a suitor in a good
position came forward for his daughter, he forbade me the house,
and made her walk daily with the gentleman whom we nick-named
&lsquo;number forty-five.&rsquo;&nbsp; I resolved to marry her as
soon as I could furnish two more rooms and had laid in a good
stock of clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My young lady studied my vegetarian books, and
determined not to eat any meat at home.&nbsp; All the family
laughed at her, but she was sufficiently resolute to withstand
ridicule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She told her father that, he having once
sanctioned her engagement to me, she must be bound to me, and
could not accept anyone else.&nbsp; Her father remonstrated with
her, but it was of no use.&nbsp; At the end of the two years,
when I had just passed my twentieth birthday, I called on her
father and said, &lsquo;I have now three rooms well furnished,
and am able to keep your daughter; I want you to fix a day for my
marrying her.&rsquo;&nbsp; He pressed my hand warmly, and said,
&lsquo;Well, I will, and give you my blessing into the
bargain.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was a good-hearted man at bottom, but
too much ruled by his wife.&nbsp; He gave my wife a good large
outfit and a purse of &pound;10, and her stepmother even gave her
&pound;2, and her brothers and sisters bought her a family Bible,
and one of them wrote in it, &lsquo;At the end of ten days their
countenances did appear fairer and fatter of flesh than all the
children which did eat the portion of the king&rsquo;s
meat&mdash;Daniel i. 15.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old gentleman laughed very much when he told me
this, and said that the vegetarianism of Daniel had been the text
of many a sermon which he had preached to his children, who,
profiting by so good an example, <i>were all vegetarians</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to resume.&nbsp; &lsquo;I found myself married and
very happy, but with 10s. a-week only.&nbsp; We laid out our
money as follows: We paid 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for three rooms,
1<i>s.</i> for fuel and light, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for food,
and had 2<i>s.</i> for other contingencies.&nbsp; Our food
consisted of&mdash;Bean stew three times a-week; potatoe pie
twice a-week; puddings without eggs twice a-week; carrots,
turnips, or some green vegetable daily.&nbsp; Our breakfast was
porridge, either of corn or oatmeal.&nbsp; We ate bread with it,
thus insuring mastication, and rendering butter, milk, tea,
coffee, or cocoa unnecessary.&nbsp; We sometimes took tea in the
evening, but oftener cold water.&nbsp; We formed <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the
acquaintance of a fruit-merchant, who, though laughing at our
vegetarianism, often sent us baskets of fruit.&nbsp; I was
married in December, and in the following November my wife had a
son.&nbsp; In a few days the wife of the head of the firm paid us
a visit, and the next day I was informed that my salary was to be
raised to 18<i>s.</i> a-week.&nbsp; I was before this in great
difficulty what to do, as I did not much like my wife being the
sole nurse of her child.&nbsp; Before this she had attended to
all our wants.&nbsp; I now took an Irish servant girl, who was
willing to be a vegetarian and receive 6<i>d.</i> a-week in wages
for the first year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was in possession, at the end of my second
year of married life, of &pound;10 sterling.&nbsp; I will now
tell you how I invested it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our firm&rsquo; was both
speculative and manufacturing, and employed some 100 workmen, who
purchased the tools they required at rather high prices in the
town.&nbsp; Ascertaining that the tools might be had cheaper at
Birmingham and Sheffield, I went myself and laid in a small
stock, which I sold within a week to the workmen at 18 per cent.
profit, but still full 10 per cent. under what they were in the
habit of paying.&nbsp; Being offered a month&rsquo;s credit, I
received a consignment of tools from Birmingham and
Sheffield.&nbsp; At the end of a year I found myself in
possession of &pound;150, which I had made by the sale of these
tools to our own hands.&nbsp; My wife kept my books, and this
little business necessitated the hiring of another room.&nbsp;
But in other respects this great increase of income did not
induce us to enlarge our expenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A foreman lost his hand through an accident, and
was incapacitated for work; I made him my traveller, to call at
other workshops and sell tools to workmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The firms at Birmingham and Sheffield had
confidence in me.&nbsp; I obtained credit more largely.&nbsp; I
engaged a warehouse and a clerk.&nbsp; At the end of my fourth
year of marriage I was in possession of &pound;1,500 by the sale
of these tools.&nbsp; I now thought of a bold project, since I
was a capitalist.&nbsp; I went to the head of our firm, and I
said, &lsquo;My wife is carrying on a business which seems likely
to produce us &pound;1,500 a-year clear profit; I have no wish to
leave your service, but I shall certainly do so, unless my salary
is raised to &pound;250 a-year.&rsquo;&nbsp; This sum being
agreed on, I was contented for the present.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;We now kept two servants, and lived in two
floors over our warehouse, and had two children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I had been married about six years, and had
three children,&rsquo; continued the old vegetarian, &lsquo;when
my warehouse and all my furniture were totally destroyed by fire;
fortunately they were insured for about &pound;5,000.&nbsp; As
this was another crisis in my career, I went to &lsquo;the
firm,&rsquo; and said, &lsquo;I now know about as much of my
business as I can learn, and have a large connection.&nbsp; I am
offered credit if I will embark my
capital&mdash;&pound;8,000&mdash;to open a business in opposition
to yours.&nbsp; But I do not want to do this if you will only
give me a liberal salary.&nbsp; I want &pound;450 a-year, and I
will carry on my business in tools in my leisure hours as
before.&rsquo;&nbsp; My terms were accepted; I was assigned a
separate office, and five clerks were at my command.&nbsp; Every
letter to me was now addressed Esquire; formerly I was only Mr.,
at least to the firm.&nbsp; I got my family arms engraved on a
seal.&nbsp; I began to dress better.&nbsp; I kept three
maid-servants and a page, and lived in a house out of the
town&mdash;a road-side villa, with vegetable
garden&mdash;bringing my expenses within the &pound;450 a-year;
reserving the profits of my business for the increase of my
capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The heads of the firm&mdash;two
brothers&mdash;paid a visit to Ireland, and, coming back, a
terrific storm arose; they were washed off the deck of the
steamer and drowned, leaving in the firm only the junior, the son
of the elder brother, a young man of twenty years of age.&nbsp;
As his capacity was moderate, and his habits not very regular,
the trustees of the two deceased partners, of their own accord,
proposed that I should receive &pound;750 per annum, take the
entire charge of the business, and stay an hour longer than
hitherto.&nbsp; But after six months, finding that I lost rather
than gained by the arrangement, as it encroached on the time I
had hitherto devoted to my private business, I plainly told the
trustees that I must be taken into partnership, or I would
abandon the concern and establish a rival business, which might
very seriously damage theirs.&nbsp; They proposed that I should
be partner for life, with &pound;1,500 a-year as a first charge
on the profits of the business, but should have no right to leave
any part of it to my family, but should have two-thirds of the
profits as surviving partner in case of the death of the present
head of the firm without children.&nbsp; A deed was executed to
embrace these provisions, and I bound <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>myself not to enter into any other
business which would aim to rival that of the firm.&nbsp; On this
I took a superior house, kept a horse and open carriage, two
gardeners, and otherwise lived at the rate of about &pound;1,200
a-year.&nbsp; My wife now retired entirely from business, which
she had seen after for about the half of three days in the
week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;About four years after this, to my sorrow, but
at the same time pecuniary advantage, the young man, my senior
partner, died, after a few days&rsquo; illness, from pleurisy,
brought on by bathing.&nbsp; His constitution was mainly built up
on beer, beef, and tobacco.&nbsp; I, a vegetarian, was never ill
after bathing.&nbsp; This young man was a martyr to the abuse of
stimulants, who his foolish doctor encouraged in their use.&nbsp;
I have made my will, and none of my children shall inherit a
penny if they are not at the time of my death vegetarians and
total abstainers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We had been so absorbed in business since we
were married, that we had not for ten years taken a sea-side
holiday; so in the summer of 1846 we determined on a yacht voyage
to last two months, from May 1st till July 1st, round the coast
of Ireland.&nbsp; We hired a yacht of fourteen tons, four men,
and a boy.&nbsp; My wife and three eldest children and self went
on board at Liverpool, and we had a most enjoyable sail until we
reached the north-west coast of Ireland.&nbsp; We landed and
explored many rocky bays, and I collected many beautiful
sea-birds&rsquo; eggs, and shot many of the more uncommon of the
sea-fowl, of which I have at present a trophy of stuffed birds,
nine feet long, in my hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wishing to see the wildest part of the Irish
coast, we sailed for the Arran Isles, and, landing there, spent
some days in examining the curious stones for which these islands
are famous.&nbsp; Some fishermen there spoke of an isolated rock
in the sea, about a quarter of a mile long, very high, with a
cavern in it, as the haunt of myriads of sea-fowl, some of
species found nowhere else in the same abundance.&nbsp; With one
of these fishermen as our pilot we reached the spot.&nbsp; There
was a heavy swell round this island-rook, and we had great
difficulty in landing.&nbsp; We determined to anchor the yacht
about half a mile off, and proceed to the island in the boat with
two of our men.&nbsp; Thinking we might like to spend the day
there, we took with us two bags of rice, a basket of oranges,
some loaves of bread, some peas and beans for soup, <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>and utensils
and wood for cooking.&nbsp; In order to afford a seat for the
children, a tin chest from the cabin, full of a variety of
provisions, was put in the boat&rsquo;s stern, and we embarked,
my wife expressing a regret that the provisions had not been
emptied out lest they should make the boat too heavy.&nbsp; With
great difficulty we managed to run the boat into a chasm about
twenty feet wide and one hundred feet long in the cliff, which
was high and very precipitous.&nbsp; This chasm formed a
miniature harbour, where the boat could lie without any danger of
being swamped, in deep water close to the cliff, against which it
was moored to a projecting rock, as to an artificial quay.&nbsp;
It was a considerable scramble to get out of the boat and up the
cliff; we just managed it, and landing our provisions, one of our
men made a fire and acted as cook, while we wandered over the
island, and explored the cave.&nbsp; It was, in fact, a sort of
twin cavern, two branches having one entrance; that on the
right-hand side was about 150 feet deep, and was not tenanted, as
it had no exit; that on the left hand was a tunnel of even
greater length, and about forty feet high; it was the
nesting-place of many sea-birds; cormorants, puffins, guillemots,
razorbills, several species of seagulls, the arctic tern and
gannet very abundant, and a few pairs of the shearwater; of some
sort we took a good many eggs.&nbsp; We packed baskets with at
least 100 dozen.&nbsp; I did not shoot, as I did not like
disturbing the birds, they were so tame, being but little
accustomed to the visits of man.&nbsp; There were some goats on
the island, which we conjectured had swum ashore from a
shipwrecked vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This plateau, which was the highest part of the
island, was reached by a path ascending about 200 feet.&nbsp; It
was a beautiful emerald meadow, bounded by almost precipitous
cliffs, which my eldest boy and I climbed up, but my wife
declined the ascent.&nbsp; At about five we sat down to our
dinner of pea-soup, boiled cabbage, bread, haricot beans,
batter-pudding, and fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We were seated in the entrance of the cave, when
suddenly a storm sprang up.&nbsp; The wind was so violent, that
though we sadly wished it, we did not deem it prudent to get into
our boat to rejoin the yacht.&nbsp; One of the sailors went on a
high part of the island to observe, and soon informed us that the
yacht had apparently dragged its anchor, and was fast
disappearing.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;We were all in a sad dilemma.&nbsp;
Leaving my dinner unfinished, I, with my eldest son, went up the
cliff; the yacht was nowhere to be seen, and the wind was so
violent that we were hardly able to keep our feet on the
cliff.&nbsp; I came down, and said we should be obliged to pass
the night on the island.&nbsp; Accordingly, the sailors brought
out of the boat all we had left in it, including some shawls, a
large fur rug, and two sails and a quantity of tarpaulin, which
we had intended to sit on had the ground been damp.&nbsp;
Lighting a small lamp, I made a careful survey of the right-hand
cavern; it was not straight, but turned at a sharp angle; the
floor was dry, as were also the walls.&nbsp; I collected a heap
of loose dry sand eight or ten feet long, by as many feet wide,
and in this I spread the tarpaulin, and over this some
shawls.&nbsp; As it got dark, myself, wife, and three children
lay down on this extemporised bed, covering ourselves with the
large fur rug.&nbsp; The wind made a great noise.&nbsp; The
sailors lay down a short distance from us, wrapped in the
sails.&nbsp; The next morning, between five and six, we were all
up, and I made an inventory of our provisions.&nbsp; We had about
eight pounds of oatmeal, about the same quantity of haricot
beans, about fourteen pounds of lentils, about twelve pounds of
maize flour, three pounds of arrowroot, two pounds of potatoes, a
cabbage, four loaves of bread, and about a dozen oranges.&nbsp;
With economy, we had vegetarian provisions to last a fortnight,
if we could get fresh water&mdash;as yet we had found none.&nbsp;
In the cavern where the sea-birds were, there was a patch of
green moss on the wall, nearly obscuring a deep crack, extending
for some yards into the rock.&nbsp; On putting my ear to the
crack I distinctly heard water dropping.&nbsp; I tied a towel to
a walking-stick and poked it into the crack, and pulled out the
towel dripping.&nbsp; By dint of probing the rock, I increased
the supply, and at last was enabled to get an oar into the crack,
which, being placed obliquely, acted as a lead to the water,
which now trickled down sufficiently fast to fill a tin can of a
gallon capacity in about a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; I considered
this providential.&nbsp; We were on this island ten days, and
slept in the same manner.&nbsp; During the day we kept a sail on
an oar attached to the boat&rsquo;s mast, on the highest part of
the island, as a signal of distress.&nbsp; We saw several
vessels, but they did not come near the island.&nbsp; At last a
smack lay to, and sent a boat to the island, and in about an hour
we <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>were on
board the smack.&nbsp; On the island we adhered strictly to our
vegetarian diet, substituting sea-fowls&rsquo; eggs for
hens&rsquo; eggs. <a name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The sailors killed and roasted two kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The smack put us on shore at Dingle Bay, and
after a month&rsquo;s travel in Ireland we returned home, and
heard that our sailors, taking advantage of our absence, had
drunk too much of the store of rum they had provided at their own
expense for the voyage, and that the vessel, becoming
unmanageable, had capsised, the two men and pilot being drowned,
the boy alone escaping, and, clinging to the keel of the yacht,
he was picked up a few hours after.&nbsp; The yacht was righted
by some fishermen, and eventually brought to the Isle of Man,
where she was claimed by her owners, who had to pay a salvage of
&pound;70.&nbsp; As this incident had occurred during my hiring
of her, I recouped them of part, and received back my baggage,
not so very much injured as I expected.&nbsp; At the bottom of
our box of provisions were some seeds from our garden, which we
were carrying to distribute amongst the poor Irish at the places
where we landed; so, thinking that some future shipwrecked
wanderers might be benefited thereby, I cleared a patch of
ground, and planted carrot, parsnip, and cabbage seed, before I
left the little island; hoping, but not expecting, the goats
would leave the tender vegetables unmolested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I had been married about sixteen years, when I
resolved to print a pamphlet on the subject of vegetarianism,
giving my experiences and those of my wife and family.&nbsp; I
gave away 2,000 copies, and with some result, for they were the
means of adding over forty to the vegetarian flock.&nbsp; In this
pamphlet I propounded a scheme for the renovation of my
neighbourhood on vegetarian principles.&nbsp; At this time I
employed about eight servants, male and female, in the house and
garden.&nbsp; I gave the men 14<i>s.</i> a-week to find
themselves, and they were allowed a certain proportion of such
common vegetables as potatoes, carrots, turnips, and onions
free.&nbsp; Being married men, they had each a distinct cottage,
large and comfortable, with an ornamental flower-garden in front,
and a fruit-garden at the back.&nbsp; They were built in the
Gothic style, after my own design.&nbsp; Each of them kept bees
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and fowls
for their own profit.&nbsp; Their style of living was the envy of
all their neighbours.&nbsp; I allow none of them to take lodgers,
and insisted on cleanliness; no rooms were papered, but all were
whitewashed annually.&nbsp; During the many years that have
elapsed since the first cottage was built, according to this
plan, I have added to them, until the number has reached
fourteen.&nbsp; They are mostly inhabited by Scotchmen.&nbsp;
They are all temperance men, anti-tobacco, and mostly
vegetarians.&nbsp; I do not give a man a cottage to himself until
he is married to a clean, orderly, industrious women.&nbsp; My
labourers&rsquo; children turn out well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One cottage is inhabited by my second gardener
and his wife, without children.&nbsp; She teaches the boys and
girls of the other cottages, and has done so for twenty
years.&nbsp; I pay her &pound;30 a-year.&nbsp; She was a trained
schoolmistress before she was married.&nbsp; My head gardener is
a religious man, and holds divine service in one of my barns, for
about 100 persons connected with the estate.&nbsp; It is like a
mother&rsquo;s meeting, children of all ages being present.&nbsp;
I am not sorry for this, for the parson of the neighbourhood is a
great man for beef and beer, and his influence I dread on my
little Arcadia.&nbsp; My head gardener now and then gives a
lecture on vegetarianism in school-rooms, and we two have drown
up a table suggestive of expenditure for rich and poor.&nbsp; Out
of his wages he keeps his father and mother and two maiden aunts,
comfortably, at an expenditure of about 7<i>s.</i> per
week.&nbsp; He is an Aberdeenshire man, and about forty years of
age.&nbsp; I hope his eldest son will become an eminent man; and
I am paying for his education at one of the universities, on
account of his extraordinary ability and fine natural
disposition, and also on account of the respect which I feel for
his father, who has helped me to carry out my principles on my
estate.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s parents and aunts live in
Aberdeenshire, and have never been on the parish.&nbsp; The laird
gives them three rooms over an outhouse at 6<i>d.</i>
a-week.&nbsp; They spent 2<i>s.</i> a-week on oatmeal, and
1<i>s.</i> a-week on milk.&nbsp; They grow vegetables enough to
make a stew for dinner; a shilling&rsquo;s-worth of flour gives
them a meal of bread in the evening.&nbsp; They eat their bread
without butter, but with their vegetable soup, made either of
peas or beans; 3<i>d.</i> buys what condiments or groceries they
require.&nbsp; They are always clean and tidy, and gather what
fuel they need from the peat on the moor.&nbsp; The blind aunts
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>are very
strong, whereas the father is very feeble.&nbsp; They work the
garden and collect the wood, he going with them to lead them on
their way.&nbsp; My gardener has drawn up a table how an adult
man may supply himself with wholesome food, lodging, and clothing
at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week on vegetarian principles.&nbsp;
He can get a room unfurnished for 1<i>s.</i> a-week; he can get
attendance, to a certain extent, for 1<i>s.</i> a-week extra; his
broad bill need not be more than 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week;
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for green vegetables, including potatoes;
6<i>d.</i> for butter or oil; 6<i>d.</i> for cocoa, and
6<i>d.</i> for groceries; 6<i>d.</i> for clothing 6<i>d.</i> for
washing.&nbsp; So the money is spent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some of my gardeners&rsquo; sons, trained on the
estate, spend no more when they go away from it.&nbsp; In one of
them, named Dickenson, I have always taken a great interest, as
he was the first born on the estate, and for a humble working man
he has had a glorious career.&nbsp; At sixteen I gave him 16s.
a-week for attending to my stove plants.&nbsp; At fourteen he had
10<i>s.</i> a-week.&nbsp; When he was eighteen a nobleman&rsquo;s
steward saw him, and offered him 30<i>s.</i> a-week to
superintended a great stove-house.&nbsp; As I could not give such
wages I let him go, but with great reluctance.&nbsp; He wrote to
his father that, although he got 30<i>s.</i> a-week and many
perquisites, yet he limited his expenditure to 8<i>s.</i> a-week
until they offered to feed him and house him, when he cut down
his expenditure to 3<i>s.</i> a-week.&nbsp; He could have had the
best of meat, but he still preferred the vegetarian diet, and he
induced two of the other servants, who were much troubled with
indigestion, to become vegetarians.&nbsp; This vegetarian
movement in the servants&rsquo; hall attracted the notice of the
nobleman, who was much pleased to hear of it.&nbsp; By the
greater use of vegetables than had been done formerly, especially
by the introduction of potato pie, haricot-bean stew, and
macaroni as every-day dishes in the servants&rsquo; hall, a
saving of &pound;500 per annum was effected in the commissariat
of the vast establishment; therefore the nobleman was well
satisfied, and presented my young Dickenson with a gold watch and
chain, value &pound;36, with an inscription, acknowledging his
economy and fidelity.&nbsp; Dickenson&rsquo;s head was not turned
by all this, although his wages were soon after raised to
&pound;3 per week, and all food found.&nbsp; When the nobleman
died, his successor presented Dickenson with &pound;250,
accompanied <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>by a flattering letter, and retained him in his service
at a salary of &pound;200 a-year, Dickenson still living as he
did before.&nbsp; After eighteen years&rsquo; service he was
pensioned off with &pound;100 per annum, and now has a nursery of
his own, and is reputed to be worth between &pound;7,000 and
&pound;8,000, although he is not more than forty years of
age.&nbsp; He has married lately a most frugal but accomplished
governess, who has saved &pound;2,000.&nbsp; She was not a
vegetarian when he married her, but is so now.&nbsp; I am as
proud of Dickenson as if he was my own son.&nbsp; His sister is a
most exemplary vegetarian governess; she has induced no less than
eight families, with whom she has lived, to become vegetarians;
and from her economy in her dress she has saved, in the course of
twenty years of governessing, &pound;400.&nbsp; On her showing me
her bank-book I added &pound;100 to it, and said if she saved
&pound;1,000 during my lifetime, I would add &pound;500 to
it.&nbsp; She is trying hard, and her brother has given her
&pound;110 towards it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My eldest unmarried daughter keeps my domestic
accounts most beautifully, and audits those of any of the people
I employ, with the object of impressing on them the advantages of
economy.&nbsp; I have intimated to my children, that in
proportion as they save they shall inherit.&nbsp; This may be an
excess of paternal government in the estimation of many, but it
has had a most beneficial effect.&nbsp; My family are so
methodical and self-denying that they are said to realise some
people&rsquo;s idea of Quakers; but I have had little intercourse
with that sect.&nbsp; The success of my own offspring, and the
prosperity of my household and establishment, as you remarked to
me, seemed to be due to an exceptional combination of qualities
and circumstances&mdash;in my wife and myself in the first
instance, and, secondly, in those I employ, who are somewhat like
myself.&nbsp; This is true, I will admit; but it does not
militate against the great principle as laid down in the Bible,
that &lsquo;the hand of the diligent maketh rich,&rsquo; that
&lsquo;industry has its sure reward,&rsquo; and that those who
honour their parents shall receive blessing.&nbsp; I have done
more for my parents than all my brothers and sisters united, and
I have received more blessing than all my brothers and sisters
united.&nbsp; Pardon my egotism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will give you a few facts of vegetarians in
our county.&nbsp; A squire and magistrate, with &pound;2,000
a-year, used to spend &pound;1,500 as a flesh-eater; he new
spends &pound;1,150, and is more <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>comfortable, as a vegetarian.&nbsp; A
barrister, whose doctor assured him that he should take three
meals of meat and a bottle of wine daily for his health&rsquo;s
sake, now finds that by a vegetarian and temperance diet his
expenses are reduced more than one-half, his health is better,
and there is a corresponding increase of vigour and power of
sustaining labour, such as he never before knew.&nbsp; A
struggling clergyman, whom custom induced, he called it
&lsquo;compelled,&rsquo; to take three meals of meat daily, was
under this system always in debt, and obliged to send the
churchwardens, round every Christmas to ask for means to pay his
way: now, on the vegetarian diet, he balances his income and
expenditure, and is able to carry forward a few pounds every
quarter.&nbsp; I believe, from more than forty years&rsquo;
experience of the vegetarian diet, that were it generally
adopted, nine-tenths of the pauperism and crime would disappear,
that England would be able to supply herself with all the
home-grown corn she requires, and that the national debt, if
deemed desirable, could be paid off in thirty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I corresponded regularly with my parents, and
they, hearing I was getting into comfortable circumstances, would
frequently write me complaints of poverty.&nbsp; To these I
responded by remittances of money, and at this time wrote to my
father, saying I would allow him &pound;25 a-year, and my mother
a similar amount.&nbsp; I visited my father about once in two
years, but always took a lodging, and took my meals apart from
him, for he was an inveterate smoker and a great beer-drinker,
and filled his snuff-box three times weekly.&nbsp; I once made a
random calculation that he had wasted &pound;1,500 on stimulants
in his life.&nbsp; These reflections prevented me from being more
liberal to him.&nbsp; If I had given him &pound;100 a-year, I
only know he would have spent more on cigars.&nbsp; He would have
bought wine at 6<i>s.</i> a bottle, and, perhaps, have increased
his consumption of snuff.&nbsp; On getting a legacy of &pound;75
once, &pound;40 went to pay his publican&rsquo;s bill.&nbsp; One
day my father wrote asking me to accommodate my youngest brother
and two sisters a few weeks, that they might see the sights of
the town and get change of air.&nbsp; I wrote to my father that
my wife and I would be very glad to see them, but they must not
expect us to make any change in our vegetarian and temperance
diet, but at the same time intimating that our style of living
was very comfortable.&nbsp; There was an <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>amount of
formality between me and my father; he would sometimes call me,
in derision, the Joseph of the family, because I went away from
the rest and got rich, and I held his ill-success in life to be
owing to his improvidence and self-indulgence, and feared he
might want me to keep the whole family in idleness; accordingly I
was not very much pleased at his proposal to send my sisters and
younger brother to me.&nbsp; However, I assented, and they
came.&nbsp; My elder sister, Mary Ann, was one of those sulky,
vain, indolent natures which neither my wife nor I can sympathise
with at all.&nbsp; Public opinion was her god, and Mrs. Grundy
her godmother.&nbsp; One day she said to my wife, &lsquo;I wonder
you can endure to live as you do with your means; it strikes me
as being very poor and miserable.&nbsp; Most people of your means
have three meals of meat a-day.&nbsp; Do you never feel tired of
the vegetables?&rsquo;&nbsp; My wife said no, and that she did
not think she could preserve the same health and strength on a
meat diet.&nbsp; My wife rose at six, and went to bed at
half-past ten, whereas Mary Ann and her sister could not get down
to breakfast till ten at home; but when they were with us we took
care to have the breakfast cleared away at eight, so that if they
came down at ten they had to wait till lunch before they got
anything to eat.&nbsp; This strict commissariat roused Mary Ann
two hours sooner than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mary Ann was fantastic in her dress, and talked
a great deal of nonsense to the servants, endeavouring to make
them discontented with the vegetarian diet, and one of them gave
notice to leave in consequence; so I thought it was time to
settle with my sisters, and I placed them in a lodging and gave
them &pound;2 a-week to feed themselves as they chose, but they
were welcome to come to our meals when they liked.&nbsp; To my
surprise, although professing abhorrence of a vegetarian diet,
they all came to take dinner and tea with us.&nbsp; My sisters
were without watches or jewellery of any kind, and begged me to
supply them.&nbsp; This I did, at a cost of about
&pound;40.&nbsp; My other sisters living at home, as well as
those married and away, hearing of these gifts, wrote to me and
demanded similar presents almost as a matter of right.&nbsp; I
complied, although it cost me &pound;120 more.&nbsp; I began to
be weary of my family connections; they were no comfort to me,
and my elder daughters began to be impertinent in consequence of
the example of their aunts.&nbsp; My wife and I, when <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>they left,
resolved to drop all intercourse with them, lest the evil
association might impair the discipline of our house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After staying six months, instead of a few
weeks, my sisters and little brother left, saying they would
probably come again about the same time next year.&nbsp; True to
their promise they appeared the next year, and asked me to take a
lodging for them as before.&nbsp; As they had come without any
invitation, I thought that I would now for the first time read
them a moral lecture, which, for the sake of the other members of
the family, I put in the form of a letter, which was a good deal
to the following effect.&nbsp; I have a copy of it in my
letter-book at home.&nbsp; It began:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Mary Ann, and my Sisters and
Brothers,&mdash;After some prayer, I consider it my solemn duty
to write to you, and warn you of your dangerous position.&nbsp;
There is not one of you that fears God: you all are steeped in
self-indulgence of one kind or another.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
mention names, but I put it to your consciences whether any of
you have ever denied yourselves to do any good action; whether or
not you have not lived lives purely selfish.&nbsp; You wrangled
and quarrelled like vultures at your meals, each demanding the
largest share.&nbsp; You girls esteemed it degrading to make your
own clothes when your milliner&rsquo;s rags were worn out, and
adopted a style of dress which to my mind seemed a
burlesque.&nbsp; You were at good schools, but you were too
indolent to make good use of them; and your brothers have spent a
small fortune on stimulants.&nbsp; Your marriages have all been
contemptible.&nbsp; Finally, let me say I have no respect for any
of you; but, as I fear God, I will not see you want.&nbsp; Those
of you, married and single, who will become vegetarians and
renounce stimulants, I will endeavour to assist in life, provided
you bring up your children as vegetarians.&nbsp; But I shall
renounce all connection with those relatives who do not in six
months become vegetarians.&nbsp; I feel impelled to do so by a
sense of duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I had this letter printed, and sent a copy to
all my brothers and sisters; most of them replied, and said they
would consider the proposal.&nbsp; Of my numerous brothers and
sisters, none were at this time in prosperous circumstances, and
yet they had all had a much better chance than I; more money had
been spent on their education, and all of them had some legacies
left them by an uncle, who left me nothing, as I was supposed to
be separated from the rest.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;After spending about &pound;15,000 in
endeavouring to benefit my brothers and sisters and their
children, I have determined to spend no more money on them, as
they are incorrigibly self-indulgent, reckless, and
vain-glorious, but keep all my money for my own offspring and
those whom I can morally respect.&nbsp; Do you not think I am
right, Mr. Napier?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will now tell you the state of my
family.&nbsp; They are all healthy and well formed, luxuriant in
hair, sound in teeth, and much better proportioned in feature and
figure than usual.&nbsp; I confess, sir, that I take no small
pleasure in my family.&nbsp; Even my married children do nothing
of importance without consulting me.&nbsp; I share my income
liberally with them; but they, with commendable prudence, live
plainly and economically, and save much; some are better at it
than others, but I cannot complain of any of them; they are
liberal too.&nbsp; My grown-up sons spend a tenth of their
incomes on moral and religious purposes.&nbsp; I do not devote
much time to business now&mdash;not more than three hours daily;
literary, scientific, and other intellectual pursuits fill up the
rest of my time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vegetarian&rsquo;s wife described their mansion in
the country as containing thirty rooms, among which is a fine
picture-gallery, 90 feet long; about twenty conservatories and
thirty gardeners are attached to the house.&nbsp; By the sale of
early fruits and vegetables, and the rearing of certain orchids,
the great expense of this wholesale gardening is reduced to about
&pound;1,000 a-year, which her husband does not wish this hobby
to exceed.&nbsp; He grows grapes throughout the greater part of
the year, and pine-apples also, so that the dessert-fruit on his
table is scarcely to be surpassed.&nbsp; His entire
living-expenses do not exceed &pound;3,000 a-year, although his
income is something like six times that amount.&nbsp; Sometimes
he will spend &pound;3,000 a-year in relieving distress, as he
did at the time of the cotton famine.&nbsp; His wife said he is
so shy and reserved with people in general that he avoids
society; but rich people are sought after, and he sometimes
receives a thousand begging-letters in the year.&nbsp; He thought
his life ought to be written, and added as an appendix to Mr.
Smiles&rsquo;s &lsquo;Self-Help;&rsquo; and so I have sent this
sketch of it for publication.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vegetarianism has been a stepping-stone to wealth in more than
one instance.&nbsp; Undoubtedly Franklin&rsquo;s vegetarianism <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>was useful to
him in a pecuniary as well as in a moral point of view.&nbsp; He
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;When about sixteen years of age, I happened
to meet with a book written by one Tryson, recommending a
vegetable diet.&nbsp; I determined to go into it.&nbsp; My
brother, being unmarried, did not keep home, but boarded himself
and his apprentices in another family.&nbsp; My refusing to eat
flesh occasioned an inconvenience, and I was frequently chid for
my singularity.&nbsp; I made myself acquainted with
Tryson&rsquo;s manner of preparing some of his dishes&mdash;such
as boiling potatoes or rice, making pastry, puddings, and a few
others; and then proposed to my brother, that if he would give
me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would board
myself.&nbsp; He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found
that I could save half what he paid me.&nbsp; This was an
additional fund for the buying of books; but I had another
advantage in it.&nbsp; My brother and the rest going from the
printing-house to their meals, I remained there alone, and,
despatching presently my light repast (which was often no more
than a biscuit or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins, or a
tart from the pastrycook&rsquo;s, and a glass of water), had the
rest of the time till their return for study, in which I made the
greater progress from that greater clearness of head and quicker
apprehension which generally attend temperance in eating and
drinking.&nbsp; Now it was that, being on some occasion made
ashamed of my ignorance in figures, which I had twice failed
learning when at school, I took Cocker&rsquo;s book on
&lsquo;Arithmetic,&rsquo; and went through the whole by myself
with the greatest ease.&nbsp; I also read Seller&rsquo;s and
Thorny&rsquo;s book on &lsquo;Navigation,&rsquo; which made me
acquainted with the little geometry it contains; but I never
proceeded far in that science.&nbsp; I also read, about this
time, Locke on the &lsquo;Human Understanding;&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Art of Thinking,&rsquo; by one of the writers of Port
Royal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vegetarians would do better did they exercise more of the
grace of charity.&nbsp; In one of the numbers of <i>Social
Notes</i>, Mr. Nunn, who is secretary of the &ldquo;Food Reform
Society,&rdquo; is indignant at the bill of fare in the coffee
public-houses.&nbsp; The food is &ldquo;too stimulating, and not
at all in accordance with dietetic principles.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
sell &ldquo;the highly-seasoned, and drunkard&rsquo;s
thirst-creating, and expensive corned beef,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;innutritious and indigestible ham and bacon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Worse than all, the unhappy directors &ldquo;must needs, of all
miserable <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>and doubtful food, sell&mdash;pork sausages;&rdquo; and
not only pork sausages, but wheaten bread; and not only wheaten
bread&mdash;tell it not in Seven Dials!&mdash;but absolutely
&ldquo;pander to the wretched drunkard&rsquo;s appetite for
stimulating, innutritious, unhealthy, and expensive food,&rdquo;
by letting their customers have beef-steaks!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says the <i>Echo</i>, &ldquo;allowing all of
Mr. Nunn&rsquo;s premises&mdash;and we gladly allow many of
them&mdash;we think he is going a little too far, and certainly a
good deal too fast.&nbsp; To attempt to entirely alter the food
proclivities of the British workman while the experiment of the
coffee public-house is yet unsolved, would, we humbly think, be
decidedly of that character.&nbsp; It might be perfectly true
that pork sausages and wheaten bread are not the most
theoretically nutritious of food, and that they provoke
thirst.&nbsp; Yet we fancy if the journeyman bricklayer could not
get them in the coffee-house, he would seek them in the
public-house, which it is the object of the directors of the
former to win him away from.&nbsp; When one has to choose between
gin and beef we fancy even Mr. Nunn would agree that the latter
is of two evils the least.&nbsp; Accordingly we think that to a
more convenient season it would be well to relegate the
reformation of the coffee public-houses bill of fare.&rdquo;</p>

93</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A FORTUNE MADE BY TEETOTALISM.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Vegetarianism</span> has made many people
rich, but much more money has been made by men who have given up
the practice of drinking beer, or wine, or spirits, and have
profitably invested the money which would have otherwise been
spent at the public-house.&nbsp; In every town and city and
village in the land, there are men who, by their temperance, have
thus raised themselves into a condition of comparative wealth and
independence.&nbsp; I have met with hundreds of such men.&nbsp;
Let me give, as an illustration, the career of Mr. James
M&lsquo;Currey, who claims to be the teetotal father of the Rev.
Dr. Robert Maguire.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Currey was born in Glasgow, as
far back as 1801, and he is now, in the year 1878, a fine
hearty-looking old man, with apparently many years of usefulness
before him.&nbsp; His parents were working people, and when
M&lsquo;Currey first went to work as a lad, his chief employment
was to fetch in the drink for the men, and for his reward to have
a sup for himself.&nbsp; No wonder the lad at times drank, and,
as he says, worked hard in the workshop, and worked with equal
energy at the devil&rsquo;s workshop, the public-house.&nbsp;
Fortunately, he married a good wife, who was no friend to the
whiskey; and owing to her influence he left off going to the
public-house; but even then, when he came to London and got good
work, he took occasionally to drinking.&nbsp; He
writes&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dearly loved my wife and child, but drink came
between me, and them.&nbsp; Ever, on my senses returning, my
remorse was horrible, more than I could bear.&nbsp; I longed to
get away from my work&mdash;from London, anywhere.&nbsp; Hard
times came; years of trial to my wife, of reproach to me, in
which I was miserable when drunk, and more miserable when
sober.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happily, in 1828&ndash;9, he became a
Christian <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>man, and a very earnest one; but even then he had not
taken the pledge, and had much trouble in consequence.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, he was at work in Theobald&rsquo;s Road, and when
the men were paid they used to go to the public-house to get
change, and M&lsquo;Currey went with the rest.&nbsp; One day,
just as he was going through the passage of the inn, the head
foreman, who was in the parlour, saw him passing, and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come in here, M&lsquo;Currey;&rsquo; and in the
next moment he had handed me a glass of brandy-and-water, which
was lying before him on the table.&nbsp; He then said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sit down and have a pipe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being called upon to do this by a man in his position,
I did so, for I thought to myself I cannot very well say
&lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; The tempter came in an insidious form,
and I fell before his wiles.&nbsp; That night I was taken home
drunk to my wife.&nbsp; She was fit to go beside herself with
grief.&nbsp; There was I lying drunk in the house, where, for a
long time past, we had been so comfortable.&nbsp; I, who had been
one of the visitors of the Strangers&rsquo; Friend; I, who had
gone to Guy&rsquo;s Hospital to talk to people about their
soul&rsquo;s eternal salvation; there was I, lying drunk.&nbsp;
It was a dreadful fall for me.&nbsp; I went to my class-leader
about it.&nbsp; He said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Brother M&lsquo;Currey, what is the
matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him; but there he was, the man to whom I had
gone for advice, sitting with a bottle of gin on the table, and a
jug of spring water.&nbsp; He filled up some and handed it to
me.&nbsp; He said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You see, Mr. M&lsquo;Currey, you take too much;
take a little now and it will steady your nerves;&rsquo; for I
was trembling like a leaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is the accursed little, sir, that is the
stumblingblock to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind; you take a little of this, and
don&rsquo;t be tempted to take too much.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need not say that Mr. M&lsquo;Currey took some of what was
offered him; but he was glad to leave his class-leader&rsquo;s
presence, and church, and neighbourhood, and he went to work at
Chelsea.&nbsp; There he met with a teetotaller, who persuaded him
to go to a temperance meeting.&nbsp; He did, and became a
teetotaller.&nbsp; The struggle at first was long and
severe.&nbsp; Times were bad, and he had to borrow tools to go to
work with.&nbsp; He had also at that time (1837) much opposition
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>to
encounter from his fellow-workmen, who often injured his clothes
and his tools, and were ready to do him all the harm they
could.&nbsp; At length he borrowed a sovereign, and commenced
selling coke in the streets till better days came round, and in a
little while he commenced his career as a master-builder.&nbsp;
It is thus he writes in his interesting autobiography:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a very noble verse of my countryman, Robert
Burns, which I have ever heard with admiration:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To catch Dame Fortune&rsquo;s golden
smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Assiduous wait upon her,<br />
And gather gear by every wile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s justified by honour.<br />
Not for to hide it in a hedge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not for a train attendant,<br />
But for the glorious privilege<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of being independent.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That motive seems to me to be right for both
worlds.&nbsp; Honest independence leads to true Christian
manliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time Buckingham Palace was under repairs.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Currey writes&mdash;&ldquo;I was one of those employed on
this important structure.&nbsp; I very frequently used to be
working for the Baroness Burdett Coutts, Lord Paget, and others
in the same rank of life.&nbsp; When I was at work one Saturday,
some one came in and said that her Majesty was expected home, and
that the apartments which she occupied must be finished by a
certain time that was named; and, in order to get them done by
the appointed time, my employer, a Mr. Evans, said I must work
all Sunday.&nbsp; I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will not work at all on Sunday, though I am
prepared to work till midnight every other day to get the work
done, or I am willing to come at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning
on Monday, and work till it is finished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;You are not a loyal subject.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I am; and if anybody were to tell me the
palace was on fire, and her Majesty inside, I would risk my life
to save her; but I won&rsquo;t risk my soul for the sake of
working on Sundays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The consequence of all this was, that I got my
discharge, and from that moment I began to get on, on my own
account.&nbsp; This was one of God&rsquo;s blessings in
disguise.&nbsp; When I came home my wife said&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind about it;&rsquo; and we kneeled
down and prayed, and we opened the hymn-hook at the very hymn
where it says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ye fearful saints fresh courage
take;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds ye so much dread<br />
Are big with mercy, and shall break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In blessings on your head.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I was really encouraged by this.&nbsp; It seemed like
the omen of mercy and goodness, which has ever since followed me
in my path through life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I left working at her Majesty&rsquo;s palace, I,
under the circumstances mentioned, had arrived at a turning-point
in my worldly fortunes.&nbsp; Shakspeare has said, that
&lsquo;there is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the
flood, leads on to fortune;&rsquo; and I believe the tide of my
fortunes came at this time; and, through the blessing of God, it
was taken at the flood.&nbsp; If it has not led me on to fortune,
it has at least led me to a position of comfort and
respectability, which at one period of my life I would have
deemed it impossible for me, by any amount of diligence, to
attain.&nbsp; I was without work and without friends, though,
thanks to teetotalism, I had a little money deposited in a place
where I could easily get it, the savings-bank at Chelsea.&nbsp;
It was in the year 1849 that I went to see Mr. Thomas Cubitt,
whom I desire to mention with gratitude and respect.&nbsp; I told
him my circumstances, and that I wanted to build a house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;take a piece of
ground for half-a-dozen houses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am frightened to go too far at first,&rsquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;there is
nothing like making sure steps.&nbsp; You are our temperance
man,&rsquo; he added; &lsquo;I remember you well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the commencement of my rise in the world above
the position of a common journeyman.&nbsp; Mr. Cubitt offered me
bricks upon credit, sufficient to get the roof on, if I could
find money for the rest.&nbsp; I had &pound;65 of my own, the
savings of three years&rsquo; teetotalism; and to work I went,
and soon got the skeleton of the house up, on the piece of ground
he granted in Wellington Street, Pimlico.&nbsp; Although I used
to rise with the lark, I was, nevertheless, at a teetotal meeting
every night; while on Sunday I was lecturing all day long.&nbsp;
I would not give up my temperance work for any man<a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>or
anything.&nbsp; My son and myself used to get up at four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and make up a batch of mortar, so
as to be able to set the labourers to work when they came.&nbsp;
We had two labourers to assist us, and now and then I took on a
man, just to give him a little help to bide over the hard time
immediately succeeding his signing the pledge.&nbsp; At times I
used to go away, and perhaps my son with me, to another job,
which would bring in a little money.&nbsp; When I got the roof on
I was in a terrible fix.&nbsp; I had spent all my money; and
though Mr. Cubitt was ready to give me all I wanted, yet I did
not know him as I do now.&nbsp; I got into very low spirits; but
as, in leaving her Majesty&rsquo;s palace, I had made that a
matter of prayer, so also did I do with this.&nbsp; My wife also
prayed, and thus the matter was left, apparently, no better than
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I went down to my work as usual, and, on
looking up the street, which was then beginning to form, I saw
Mr. Robert Alsop coming along&mdash;the very man who brought two
policemen to take me in charge for holding meetings at the
&lsquo;White Stiles,&rsquo; Chelsea.&nbsp; He did this partly on
his own account, and partly because the people sent a petition to
have me removed from the spot.&nbsp; It may be as well to give a
little account of what transpired when Mr. Alsop brought the two
policemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I give,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this man in
charge.&nbsp; I have told him that the people about here are much
offended.&nbsp; We cannot allow this disturbance to go on, and a
letter has been sent on this subject.&nbsp; I therefore give him
in charge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I give Mr. Alsop in
charge; and I dare you to take me without taking him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The policemen were in a fog&mdash;likewise Mr.
Alsop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said one of them, at last,
&lsquo;it appears Mr. M&lsquo;Currey knows what he is
doing.&nbsp; We know nothing about the case; and, if you force us
to take this man in charge, we must take you too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Alsop considered for a little.&nbsp; He did not
know what to do.&nbsp; The people and the policemen were alike
awaiting his decision.&nbsp; If he persisted, he must he
conveyed, like a culprit, along with me; and he knew well that I
cared little what was done, for by this time the roads to the
various station-houses were getting pretty familiar.&nbsp; If, on
the contrary, he retired from the conflict, he must do so with
the <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>ridicule of all about him.&nbsp; I think he chose the
wisest course.&nbsp; He walked away amidst the derisive laughter
of the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, then, was the man whom God, and God alone, had
sent to relieve me from my embarrassment.&nbsp; I stood in front
of the house as Mr. Alsop came by, thinking what on earth I
should do, but never for a moment dreaming that he was likely to
be a customer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What will be the amount?&rsquo; said Mr. Alsop,
pausing in his walk, and looking up at the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;When it is finished, and you have a good
tenant, I will sell it to you for &pound;380.&nbsp; It has a
sixteen-feet frontage, and is twenty-six feet deep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is the tenant to be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will be your tenant.&nbsp; I will take it for
five or seven years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I will think of it.&nbsp; I will call and
see thee to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As usual, I made it a matter of prayer.&nbsp; The
reader may be sure that I kept a good look-out for my customer
the next day, but did not let him see that I was at all anxious
about the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you thought about what I said?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows I had not slept for thinking of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I have; and I will take &pound;380 for it,
and be your tenant for three, five, or seven years.&nbsp; I am
going to leave my present house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will give you &pound;330,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, I will take that.&nbsp; You know it
is usual to pay a deposit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes; how much do you want?&nbsp; I have
brought a bank cheque.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&pound;150 would be enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can have more&mdash;say
&pound;200.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, that will do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He filled up the cheque for the last-mentioned
amount, and we parted for the time.&nbsp; I was in the highest
spirits.&nbsp; My difficulties had vanished.&nbsp; With this
cheque I could command all the remaining materials that I
wanted.&nbsp; I went to Mr. Cubitt&rsquo;s office, got the boards
for the floor, and everything else, and set the carpenters to
work, early and late.&nbsp; At last it was finished.&nbsp; Before
this, however, I took ground for two more houses, which Mr. Alsop
also bought.&nbsp; The first <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>one I lived in myself for seven
years.&nbsp; This was the very man who had given me in charge
nine months before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went on building and building until I gave up taking
ground for one or two houses, but took it for ten, then fifteen,
then twenty, and then for twenty-seven.&nbsp; All one side of
Bessborough Street was built by me.&nbsp; My son was an immense
help to me.&nbsp; Of course, as might have been expected, my
career was not one of uninterrupted prosperity.&nbsp; Things went
very hard with me once or twice; but my troubles were chiefly
owing to the political commotion of the times, which disturbed
trade and unsettled men&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; The Chartist riots
did me some harm, as did also the Feargus O&rsquo;Connor
disturbances, and some trade disputes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was during the time of the Chartist disturbances
that my troubles reached their climax, and that I really thought
that results, for which I had so long laboured, were about to be
removed from my reach for ever.&nbsp; One day, when I was really
unable to say how my engagements were to be met, one of my
foremen came and said there was a gentleman waiting to see me
about a house.&nbsp; I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother! no one wants to buy a house
in these times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he is a decent-looking man,&rsquo; said the
foreman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good.&nbsp; I see no hope of
getting out of the present difficulties, and I shall have to
discharge you all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I advise you to see the man.&nbsp; He looks a
business man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to see the gentleman, who was no other than the
father of Dr. Moore.&nbsp; As it happened, this was another turn
in my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you want for this house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seven hundred guineas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I will come and look at it on Sunday with
my son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t show it to you then.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t do business on a Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well; I don&rsquo;t know that I can come
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day, which was Sunday, passed in a very
uncomfortable manner.&nbsp; Listening to the sermon, even the
thought flashed before me as to whether I had not better have
made the appointment; but it was dismissed at once.&nbsp; I was
almost glad when the Sunday was over.&nbsp; The next day <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>I really
had an impression that he would come, and I said so to my
wife.&nbsp; She agreed with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At half-past ten that morning, to my great delight, the
&rsquo;bus stopped at the corner of the street, and the young
doctor and his father alighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have told my son,&rsquo; said the doctor,
&lsquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t let us see your house on the
Sunday, and we both say you did quite right.&nbsp; If a man
can&rsquo;t do without working on a Sunday, he will never do with
it.&nbsp; I went to sea when I was fourteen years of age, and
have travelled the world almost twice over, and I have done my
business without working on Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked at the house, and liked it very well, and
then said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will give you the money in Dutch
consols.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, doctor, I don&rsquo;t know what Dutch
consols really are; I want 700 guineas in British
money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left me, the matter being still rather uncertain;
but the next day he came to see me again, and I took him into my
parlour.&nbsp; He said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have the money ready&mdash;&pound;50 for a
deposit.&nbsp; I have brought it in money, as, perhaps, you will
like it better that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you; I will give you a receipt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you
needn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I know your countrymen are a respectable lot
but for the drink, and I know you will not want to be paid
twice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The business was settled, and a friendship sprang up
between myself and the old gentleman, which lasted until he
died.&nbsp; The arrangements for his funeral were entrusted to
me, and were carried out without any of the men employed being
allowed to partake of intoxicating drinks.&nbsp; In this way
those disgraceful scenes which so frequently are associated with
funerals were altogether avoided, and I was subsequently
complimented by Dr. Moore, jun., on the highly respectable way in
which the arrangements were carried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But poor M&lsquo;Currey, when he had become well-to-do and
happy in his surroundings, had much to do from intemperance in
others.&nbsp; His eldest son fell a victim, and so did several
members of his wife&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; One son, who became a
teetotaler when his father prospered in the world, unfortunately,
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>in the
course of his business, met with an accident in falling from a
building, which caused his death at the early age of
forty-one.&nbsp; &ldquo;After providing for his family, he did
not forget,&rdquo; says the <i>Temperance Record</i>, &ldquo;the
benevolent institutions of his country.&nbsp; He has left
&pound;100 each to St. George&rsquo;s, Westminster, and
Consumptive Hospitals; &pound;100 to the Strangers&rsquo; Friend
Society, and &pound;600 to the total abstinence
cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of old M&lsquo;Currey&rsquo;s converts
said to him one day, &ldquo;You inoculated me into teetotalism,
on the White Stiles, Chelsea, at a time when I had not a
sixpence.&nbsp; I signed the pledge at one of your open-air
meetings there, fifteen years ago, and am doing well, as you may
judge from the fact that I have now three houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is thus clear that, in many quarters, teetotalism has not only
saved men from ruin, but has made them rich as well.&nbsp; In the
career of Mr. David Davies, M.P., we have a remarkable
illustration of this fact.&nbsp; He was once a
&ldquo;navvy;&rdquo; he is now (1878) a man of wealth, and a
member of parliament.</p>

102</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MONEY-MAKING PUBLISHERS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the largest publishing
houses in London, that of Messrs. Cassell, Petter, and Galpin,
was founded by John Cassell, a Lancashire carpenter, who walked
to London, and when he arrived in the metropolis, found himself
with the handsome sum of twopence-halfpenny in his pocket.&nbsp;
He was an earnest teetotaller, and became known as a temperance
lecturer.&nbsp; He next commenced the sale of coffee, and finding
that there was little wholesome reading for the class to which he
originally belonged, he commenced a cheap publication, called the
<i>Working-man&rsquo;s Friend</i>.&nbsp; In time other works
followed.&nbsp; He then got an immense number of stereos of
engravings from French publications, and began to publish
illustrated periodicals.&nbsp; In time he was joined by Messrs.
Petter and Galpin, printers; and after Mr. Cassell&rsquo;s
lamented death the firm developed the business, till it became
one of the most gigantic character.&nbsp; As an illustration of
the remarkable extent of the firm&rsquo;s business, I may mention
that, at a tea-meeting, held in the Cannon Street Hotel in the
early part of 1878, at which more than 600 workmen were present,
Mr. Jeffery, one of the partners, stated, &ldquo;That Messrs.
Cassell, Petter, and Galpin, with the view of benefiting those of
their <i>employ&eacute;s</i> who had already given, or might
hereafter give, long and faithful service to the firm, had
resolved to set aside, from year to year, a fixed proportion of
their profits to form a fund, out of which certain benefits
might, at their discretion, be paid.&nbsp; The scheme would
provide for the payment of a sum of money, varying according to
length of service, to the family or representative of any person
who might die in their employment after seven, fourteen, or
twenty-one years&rsquo; service, or, as the case might be, for
the payment of bonuses of similar amounts <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>to those
who, having served at least seven years, might be incapacitated
by old age, after the age of sixty-five, or who might before that
age be totally unable to perform any labour owing to accident or
disease.&nbsp; It had been estimated that the fund about to be
instituted would provide for the following payments:&mdash;To
overseers and managing clerks, after seven years&rsquo; service,
&pound;50; after fourteen years&rsquo; service, &pound;75; after
twenty-one years&rsquo; service, &pound;100: to clickers,
sub-foremen, and first-class clerks, after seven years&rsquo;
service, &pound;37 10<i>s.</i>; after fourteen years&rsquo;
service, &pound;56 5<i>s.</i>; after twenty-one years&rsquo;
service, &pound;75: to workmen, workwomen, and clerks, after
seven years&rsquo; service, &pound;25; after fourteen
years&rsquo; service, &pound;37 10<i>s.</i>; after twenty-one
years&rsquo; service, &pound;50.&nbsp; The scheme, which also
provided for some other payments, would come into operation from
the commencement of the present year.&nbsp; It was intended that
a periodical revision of these tables should be made by an
actuary.&nbsp; The amount appropriated for carrying out the
proposal for 1878 amounted to &pound;600, and Messrs. Cassell,
Petter, and Galpin wished to set out the fact that these benefit
arrangements were voluntary on their part, and might be withdrawn
by them, wholly or in any particular case, if they should see
reason for doing so.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is wonderful, indeed, that
such a business should have sprung from the unaided efforts of a
raw, uneducated, uncouth Lancashire lad.</p>
<p>Originally, most of the great London publishers were anything
but wealthy men.&nbsp; Jacob Tonson started with a capital of
&pound;100, left him by his father, a barber-sturgeon in
Holborn.&nbsp; He is reported to have said when he died, &ldquo;I
wish I could have the world to begin again, because then I should
have died worth &pound;100,000, whereas I am now only worth
&pound;80,000.&rdquo;&mdash;Lintott, the great rival of Tonson,
left his daughter &pound;55,000, and his son became high sheriff
of Sussex.&mdash;Edmund Curll, who was born in the West of
England, after passing through several menial capacities, became
a bookseller&rsquo;s assistant, and then kept a stall in the
purlieus of Covent Garden.&mdash;Thomas Guy, whose name is still
held in veneration as the founder of Guy&rsquo;s Hospital, was
the son of a coalheaver and lighterman.&nbsp; Very early he seems
to have contracted most frugal habits.&nbsp; According to
Nichols, he dined every day at his counter, with no other
table-cloth than an old newspaper; and he was quite as economical
in his dress.&nbsp; In order to get a frugal helpmate, he asked
his servant-maid <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>to become his wife.&nbsp; The girl, of course, was
delighted, but presumed too much on her influence over her
careful lover.&nbsp; One day, seeing that the paviers, repairing
the street in front of the house, had neglected a broken place,
she called their attention to it; but they told her that Guy had
carefully marked a particular stone, beyond which they were not
to go.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;do you
mend it; tell him I bade you, and I know he will not be
angry.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, Guy was, and the marriage did not
take place.&nbsp; As a bachelor, Guy lived to a ripe old
age.&nbsp; The cost of building Guy&rsquo;s Hospital was
&pound;18,793, end he left &pound;219,499 as an endowment.&nbsp;
He left also money to Tamworth, his mother&rsquo;s birthplace,
which he represented in parliament for many years; &pound;400
a-year to Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, and &pound;8,000 to his
relative.&mdash;Robert Dodsley, who made a handsome fortune as a
publisher, commenced life as a footman.&mdash;The far-famed
Lackington was the son of a drunken cobbler at Wellington, and
had no education at all.&nbsp; Loafing about the streets all day
as a child, he thought he might turn his talents to account by
crying pies, and as a pie-boy he acquired such a pre-eminence
that he was soon engaged to vend almanacs.&nbsp; At fourteen he
left this vagrant life to be apprenticed to a shoemaker.&nbsp; He
came to London with half-a-crown and a wife; but in time he
scraped together &pound;25, and started in business in Chiswell
Street.&nbsp; His plan was to sell for ready money, and at low
prices.&nbsp; He then bought remainders of books which were
generally destroyed, and thus he made a fortune.&nbsp; On his
chariot, when he started one, he put for his motto, &ldquo;Small
profits do great things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, he was very fond of
repeating, &ldquo;I found all I possess in small <i>profits</i>,
bound by <i>industry</i>, and <i>clasped</i> with
economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few have done better than the Chamberses, of Edinburgh.&nbsp;
After months of pence-scraping and book-hoarding, Robert
succeeded in collecting a stock worth about fifty shillings; and
with nothing but these and his yearnings for independence, and
his determination to write books by-and-by, but at present to
sell them, he, at the age of sixteen, opened a little
shop&mdash;a stall&mdash;in Leith Street.&nbsp; His brother
William also started as a bookseller and printer in the same
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>William Chambers was born in Peebles, April 16th, 1800; and
Robert, coming next in order in the family, was born <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>July 10th,
1802.&nbsp; The father carried on the hereditary trade of the
manufacture of woollen and linen clothes.&nbsp; The grandfather
held the office of elder of his church for the last thirty years
of his existence.&nbsp; The grandmother was a little woman of
plain appearance, a great stickler on points of controversial
divinity, a rigorous critic of sermons, and a severe censor of
what she considered degenerating manners.&nbsp; The mother was a
beauty, and her pretty face led her into an alliance which, in
the end, could have been productive of little happiness.&nbsp;
Mr. Chambers speaks of his father as &ldquo;accurate, upright,
aspiring in his tastes and habits, with a fund of humour and an
immense love of music.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made some progress in
science.&nbsp; &ldquo;Affected, like others at the time, with the
fascinating works of James Fergusson on astronomy, he had a kind
of rage for that branch of study, which he pursued by means of a
tolerably good telescope, in company with Mungo Park, the African
traveller, who had settled as a surgeon in Peebles, and one or
two other acquaintances.&rdquo;&nbsp; The failing of his father
was his pliancy of disposition.&nbsp; He was cheated with his
eyes open.&nbsp; For such men worldly ruin is only a question of
time.&nbsp; In a little while the family were driven from
Peebles, and William had to fight the battle of life on his own
account.&nbsp; His education, which closed when he was thirteen,
had been by no means an expensive one.&nbsp; Books included, it
had cost somewhere about sis pounds.&nbsp; For this he was well
grounded in English.&nbsp; The most distressing part of his
school exercises consisted in learning by heart the catechism of
the Westminster Assembly of Divines&mdash;a document which he
tells us it was impossible for any person under maturity to
understand, or to regard in any other light than as a
torture.&nbsp; In the case of the two brothers there was a
curious malformation.&nbsp; They were sent into the world with
six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot.&nbsp; By the
neighbours this was considered lucky.&nbsp; In the case of
William, the superfluous members were easily removed.&nbsp; It
was not so with Robert.&nbsp; The supernumerary toes on the
outside of the foot were attached to or formed part of the
metatarsal bones, and were so badly amputated as to leave
delicate protuberances, calculated to be a torment for
life.&nbsp; This unfortunate circumstance, by producing a certain
degree of lameness and difficulty in walking, no doubt helped to
make Robert the <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>studious and thoughtful man he was.&nbsp; Thus,
indisposed to boyish sports, his progress in education was
rapid.&nbsp; Indeed as William confesses, he was left far
behind.&nbsp; In 1813, the family difficulties came to a head,
and an emigration from Peebles to the gude auld town of Edinburgh
was necessitated.&nbsp; Henceforth the mother seems to have been
the head of the family.&nbsp; Chambers senior seems to have been
a bit of an incumbrance.&nbsp; Poor themselves, they were
surrounded by companions in misfortune.&nbsp; Widows of decayed
tradesmen, teachers in the decline of life too old to teach,
licensed preachers to whom an unkind fate had denied all church
preferments, genteel unmarried women who had known better times,
and who had now to eke out a precarious existence by colouring
maps, or sewing fine needlework for the repository.&nbsp; This
little pauperised colony, clinging as it were on to the skirts of
respectability, was located on flats in that part of Edinburgh
where rents were not of the highest, nor the houses of the
grandest architectural character.&nbsp; Here they met with
noteworthy individuals, and here William found his first
situation as a bookseller&rsquo;s assistant, with the magnificent
salary of four shillings a-week.&nbsp; Lad as he was, William
then laid down a resolution, which was not only heroical,
considering the depressed circumstances of his family, which may
not only be held up as an example to others, but which laid most
assuredly the foundation of his success in after-life.&nbsp;
&ldquo;From necessity,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;not less than
from choice, I resolved to make the weekly four shillings serve
for everything.&nbsp; I cannot remember entertaining the
slightest despondency on the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a lad of
fourteen thus to resolve, showed that he had the right spirit to
conquer circumstances, and to win an old age of respectability
and renown.&nbsp; As at this time his father was appointed
commercial manager of a salt manufactory, called Joppa
Pans&mdash;a smoky, odorous place, consisting of a group of
buildings situated on the sea-shore, half-way between Portobello
and Musselburgh&mdash;William was left by himself in Edinburgh to
do the best he could.&nbsp; Of course he went to lodge with a
Peebles woman, and was surrounded by a host of Peebleshire
people, whose delight in the evening was to call up reminiscences
of texts, and preachers, and sermons, and to discuss
Boston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Marrow,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Crook in the
Lot,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Fourfold State.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is to
be feared we have not <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>much improved on this.&nbsp; Such
modes of spending the evening were certainly quite equal to the
modern ones of frequenting music-halls, or of reading some of the
trash now issued from the press.&nbsp; We must add that William
Chambers had read Franklin&rsquo;s autobiography, and had imbibed
somewhat of his spirit.&nbsp; It is thus that a good, genuine
book goes on bearing fruit.&nbsp; It is thus a good example tells
in all strata of society.&nbsp; It is thus the life of one man is
a blessing in all after time.&nbsp; William Chambers all the
while pursued with more or less diligence his studies.&nbsp; He
always rose at five in the morning to have a spell at
reading.&nbsp; In the same way he made some progress in French,
with the pronunciation of which he was already familiar, from the
speech of the French prisoners of war in Peebles.&nbsp; He
likewise dipped into several books of solid worth, such as
Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wealth of Nations,&rdquo; Locke&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Human Understanding,&rdquo; Paley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moral
Philosophy,&rdquo; and Blair&rsquo;s &ldquo;Belles
Lettres.&rdquo;&nbsp; His brother Robert, who had come to live
with him, seems also to have done the same.&nbsp; In 1816, the
latter became self-supporting; he had up to that time continued
his studies in the hope of becoming a clerk or teacher.&nbsp; All
hope in that direction, fortunately for himself and his country,
was abandoned, and with a few old books, the remnant of the
family library, he started in the world as a second-hand
bookseller in Leith Walk.&nbsp; It was in 1819 that William did
the same&mdash;having left his employers&mdash;with five
shillings in his pocket, to which sum his weekly wages had
latterly been considerately advanced.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Robert
had cleared out the family stores, and there was no
stock-in-trade with which William could furnish his scanty
shelves.&nbsp; He was so fortunate, however, as to get a limited
amount of credit from a London publisher of cheap standard
literature, and thus he began a career of which he or any one
else might well be proud.&nbsp; Bookselling by itself, however,
was not sufficient; he tried caligraphy; he taught himself
bookbinding; he mastered the art of printing; he became a
publisher.&nbsp; His first book, of course, was a cheap edition
of Burns&rsquo; Songs.</p>
<p>Such is an outline of the career of the brothers.&nbsp; Then
comes the old story of success, of literary and business renown,
of happy domestic life, and of the end of all.&nbsp; Both
brothers were indefatigable writers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Altogether,&rdquo; writes William, &ldquo;as nearly as can
be reckoned, my brother produced <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>upwards of seventy volumes,
exclusively of detached papers, which it would be impossible to
enumerate.&rdquo;&nbsp; His whole writings had for their aim the
good of society, the advancement, in some shape or other, of the
true and the beautiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will hardly be
thought,&rdquo; he modestly and affectionately adds, &ldquo;that
I exceed the proper bounds of panegyric in stating that, in the
long list of literary compositions of Robert Chambers, we see the
zealous and successful student, the sagacious and benevolent
citizen, and the devoted lover of his country.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
similar eulogium may be pronounced on William himself.</p>
<p>Robert Chambers, the younger brother, thus makes us acquainted
with his evening studies while a lad at his native town of
Peebles:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among that considerable part of the population who
lived down closes and in old thatched cottages, news circulated
at third or fourth hand, or was merged in conversation on
religious or other topics.&nbsp; My brother and I derived much
enjoyment, not to say instruction, from the singing of old
ballads, and the telling of legendary stories, by a kind old
female relative, the wife of a decayed tradesman, who dwelt in
one of the ancient closes.&nbsp; At her humble fireside, under
the canopy of a huge chimney, where her half-blind and
superannuated husband sat dozing in a chair, the battle of
Corunna and other prevailing news was strangely mingled with
disquisitions on the Jewish wars.&nbsp; The source of this
interesting conversation was a well-worn copy of
L&rsquo;Estrange&rsquo;s translation of Josephus, a small folio
of date 1720.&nbsp; The envied possessor of the work was Tam
Fleck, &lsquo;a flichty chield,&rsquo; as he was considered, who,
not particularly steady at his legitimate employment, struck out
a sort of profession by going about in the evenings with his
Josephus, which he read as the current news; the only light he
had for doing so being usually that imparted by the flickering
blaze of a piece of parrot coal.&nbsp; It was his practice not to
read more than from two to three pages at a time, interlarded
with sagacious remarks of his own by way of foot-notes, and in
this way he sustained an extraordinary interest in the
narrative.&nbsp; Retailing the matter with great equability in
different households, Tam kept all at the same point of
information, and wound them up with a corresponding anxiety as to
the issue of some moving event in Hebrew annals.&nbsp; Although
in this way he <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>went through a course of Josephus yearly, the novelty
somehow never seemed to wear off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Weel, Tam, what&rsquo;s the news the
nicht?&rsquo; would old Geordie Murray say, as Tam entered with
his Josephus under his arm, and seated himself at the family
fireside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bad news, bad news,&rsquo; replied Tam.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Titus has begun to besiege Jerusalem&mdash;it&rsquo;s gaun
to be a terrible business;&rsquo; and then he opened his budget
of intelligence, to which all paid the most reverential
attention.&nbsp; The protracted and severe famine which was
endured by the besieged Jews was a theme which kept several
families in a state of agony for a week; and when Tam in his
readings came to the final conflict and destruction of the city
by the Roman general, there was a perfect paroxysm of
horror.&nbsp; At such <i>s&eacute;ances</i> my brother and I were
delighted listeners.&nbsp; All honour to the memory of Tam
Fleck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must again quote from Robert&rsquo;s reminiscences the
following characteristic anecdotes of the grandmother of the
Chamberses:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She possessed a good deal of &lsquo;character,&rsquo;
and might also be taken for the original of Mause Headrigg.&nbsp;
As the wife of a ruling elder, she possibly imagined that she was
entitled to exercise a certain authority in ecclesiastical
matters.&nbsp; An anecdote is told of her having once taken the
venerable Dr. Dalgliesh, the parish minister, through
hands.&nbsp; In presence of a number of neighbours, she thought
fit to lecture him on that particularly delicate subject, his
wife&rsquo;s dress: &lsquo;It was a sin and a shame to see sae
mickle finery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister did not deny the charge, but dexterously
encouraged her with the Socratic method of argument: &lsquo;So,
Margaret, you think that ornament is useless and sinful in a
lady&rsquo;s dress?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, may I ask why you wear that ribbon around
your cap?&nbsp; A piece of cord would surely do quite as
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disconcerted with this unforeseen turn of affairs,
Margaret determinedly rejoined in an under-tone:
&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no hae lang to speer sic a like
question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day her cap was bound with a piece of white tape;
and never afterwards, till the day of her death, did she wear a
ribbon, or any morsel of ornament.&nbsp; I am doubtful if we
could match this out of Scotland.&nbsp; For a novelist to depict
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>characters of this kind, he would require to see them
in real life; no imagination could reach them.&nbsp; Sir Walter
Scott both saw and talked with them, for they were not extinct in
his day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mortifying rebuff about the ribbon perhaps had some
influence in making my ancestress a Seceder.&nbsp; As she lived
near the manse, I am afraid she must have been a good deal of a
thorn in the side of the parish minister, notwithstanding all the
palliatives of her good-natured husband, the elder.&nbsp; At
length an incident occurred which sent her abruptly off to a
recently-erected meeting-house, to which a promising young
preacher, Mr. Leckie, had been appointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a bright summer morning, about five
o&rsquo;clock, when Margaret left her husband&rsquo;s side as
usual, and went out to see her cow attended to.&nbsp; Before
three minutes had elapsed, her husband was aroused by her coming
in with dismal cries: &lsquo;Eh, sirs! eh, sirs! did I ever think
to live to see the day?&nbsp; O man, O man, O William&mdash;this
is a terrible thing, indeed!&nbsp; Could I ever have thought to
see&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gracious, woman!&rsquo; exclaimed the worthy
elder, by this time fully awake, &lsquo;what is&rsquo;t? is the
coo deid?&rsquo; for it seemed to him that no greater calamity
could have been expected to produce such doleful
exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The coo deid!&rsquo; responded Margaret;
&lsquo;waur, waur, ten times waur.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Dr.
Dalgliesh only now gaun hame at five o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s
awfu&rsquo;!&nbsp; What will things come to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elder, though a pattern of propriety himself, is
not recorded as having taken any but a mild view of the
minister&rsquo;s conduct, more particularly as he knew that the
patron of the parish was at Miss Ritchie&rsquo;s inn, and that
the reverend divine might have been detained rather late with him
against his will.&nbsp; The strenuous Margaret drew no such
charitable conclusions.&nbsp; She joined the Secession
congregation next day, and never again attended the parish
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now pass on to Mr. William Chambers.&nbsp; He gives us a
capital picture of an old Edinburgh book auction:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter was a dry humorist, somewhat saturnine from
business misadventures.&nbsp; Professedly he was a bookseller in
South College Street, and exhibited over his door a huge sham
copy of Virgil by way of sign.&nbsp; His chief trade, however,
was the auctioning of books and stationery at the agency <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>office&mdash;a place with a strong smell of new
furniture, amidst which it was necessary to pass before arriving
at the saloon in the rear, where the auctions were habitually
held.&nbsp; Warm, well-lighted, and comfortably fitted up with
seats within a railed enclosure, environing the books to be
disposed of, this place of evening resort was as good as a
reading-room&mdash;indeed, rather better, for there was a
constant fund of amusement in Peter&rsquo;s caustic
jocularities&mdash;as when he begged to remind his audience that
this was a place for selling, not for reading
books&mdash;sarcasms which always provoked a round of ironical
applause.&nbsp; His favourite author was Goldsmith, an edition of
whose works he had published, which pretty frequently figured in
his catalogue.&nbsp; On coming to these works he always referred
to them with profound respect&mdash;as, for example: &lsquo;The
next in the catalogue, gentlemen, is the works of Oliver
<i>Gooldsmith</i>, the greatest writer that ever lived, except
Shakspeare; what do you say for it?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll put it up at
ten shillings.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some one would perhaps audaciously
bid twopence, which threw him into a rage, and he would
indignantly call out: &lsquo;Tippence, man; keep that for the
<i>brode</i>,&rsquo; meaning the plate at the church-door.&nbsp;
If the same person dared to repeat the insult with regard to some
other work, Peter would say: &lsquo;Dear me, has that poor man
not yet got quit of his tippence?&rsquo; which turned the laugh,
and effectually silenced him all the rest of the evening.&nbsp;
Peter&rsquo;s temper was apt to get ruffled when biddings
temporarily ceased.&nbsp; He then declared that he might as well
try to auction books in the poor-house.&nbsp; On such occasions,
driven to desperation, he would try the audience with a bunch of
quills, a dozen black-lead pencils, or a &lsquo;quare&rsquo; of
Bath-post, vengefully knocking which down at the price bidden for
them, he would shout to &lsquo;Wully,&rsquo; the clerk, to look
after the money.&nbsp; Never minding Peter&rsquo;s querulous
observations further than to join in the general laugh, I, like a
number of other penniless youths, got some good snatches of
reading at the auctions in the agency office.&nbsp; I there saw
and handled books which I had never before heard of, and in this
manner obtained a kind of notion of bibliography.&nbsp; My
brother, who, like myself, became a frequenter of the agency
office, relished Peter highly, and has touched him of in one of
his essays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wealthy old man was Hutton, of Birmingham, who thus <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>describes
his early struggles to set up in business as a
bookbinder:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bookbinder, fostered by the frame, was such a novelty
that many people gave me a book to bind, chiefly my acquaintances
and their friends, and I perceived two advantages attend my
work.&nbsp; I chiefly served those who were not judges;
consequently, that work passed with them which would not with a
master.&nbsp; And coming from a stockinger, it carried a merit,
because no stockinger could produce its equal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitherto I had only used the wretched tools and the
materials for binding which my bookseller chose to sell me; but I
found there were many others wanting, which were only to be had
in London; besides, I wished to fix a correspondence for what I
wanted, without purchasing at second-hand.&nbsp; There was a
necessity to take this journey; but an obstacle arose&mdash;I had
no money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sister raised three guineas; sewed them in my
shirt collar, for there was no doubt of my being robbed, and put
eleven shillings in my pocket, for it was needful to have a sop
to satisfy the rogues when they made the attack.&nbsp; From the
diminutive sum I took, it may reasonably be supposed I should
have nothing left to purchase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Monday morning at three, April 8th, I set out.&nbsp;
Not being accustomed to walk, my feet were blistered with the
first ten miles.&nbsp; I must not, however, sink under the
fatigue, but endeavour to proceed as if all were well; for much
depended on this journey.&nbsp; Aided by resolution I marched
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stopping at Leicester, I unfortunately left my knife,
and did not discover the loss till I had proceeded eleven
miles.&nbsp; I grieved, because it was the only keepsake I had of
my worthy friend, Mr. Webb.&nbsp; Ten times its value could not
have purchased it.&nbsp; I had marked it with &lsquo;July 22,
1742, W. H.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mile beyond Leicester I overtook a traveller with his
head bound.&nbsp; &lsquo;How far are you going?&rsquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;To London,&rsquo; replied I.&nbsp; &lsquo;So
am I.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;When do you expect to
arrive?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;On Wednesday night.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;So do I.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the matter with your
head?&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;have you been fighting?&rsquo;&nbsp;
He returned a blind answer, which convinced me of the
affirmative.&nbsp; I did not half like my companion, especially
as he took care to walk behind me.&nbsp; This probably, I
thought, was one of the rogues likely to attack me.&nbsp; But
when I <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>understood he was a tailor my fears rather subsided,
nor did I wonder his head was wrapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Determined upon a separation, I marched apace for
half-an-hour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you mean to hold this
rate?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is best to hold daylight while we
have it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I found I could match him at walking,
whatever I might do at fighting.&nbsp; In half-an-hour more we
came to a public-house, when he gave up the contest.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Will you step in and drink?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I
shall be moving slowly; you may soon overtake me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped at Brixworth, having walked fifty-four miles,
and my whole expense for the day was fivepence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next night, Tuesday the 9th, I reached
Dunstable.&nbsp; Passing over Finchley Common on the third day, I
overtook a carter, who told me I might be well accommodated at
the &lsquo;Horns,&rsquo; in St. John&rsquo;s Street (Smithfield),
by making use of his name.&nbsp; But it happened, in the
eagerness of talking and the sound of his noisy cart, he forgot
to tell his name, and I to ask it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived at the &lsquo;Horns&rsquo; at five; described
my director, whom they could not recollect.&nbsp; However, I was
admitted as an inmate, and then ordered a mutton-chop and porter;
but, alas!&nbsp; I was jaded, had fasted too long; my appetite
was gone, and the chop nearly useless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This meal, if it may be called a meal, was the only one
during my stay; and I think the only time I ever ate under a
roof.&nbsp; I did not know one soul in London, therefore could
have no invitations.&nbsp; Life is supported with a little; which
was well for me, because I had but little to give it.&nbsp; If a
man has any money he will see stalls enough in London, which will
supply him with something to eat, and it rests with him to lay
out his money to the best advantage.&nbsp; If he cannot afford
butter he must eat his bread without.&nbsp; This will tend to
keep up his appetite, which will always give a relish to food,
though mean; and scantiness will add to that relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning I breakfasted in Smithfield, upon
frumenty, at a wheelbarrow.&nbsp; Sometimes a half-pennyworth of
soup and another of bread; at others bread and cheese.&nbsp; When
nature calls, I must answer.&nbsp; I ate to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man goes to receive money it may take him long to
do his business.&nbsp; If to pay money, it will take him less;
and if he has but little to pay, still less.&nbsp; My errand fell
under the third.&nbsp; I only wanted three alphabets of letters,
figures, <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>and ornamental tools for gilding books, with materials
(leather and hoards) for binding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to see a number of curiosities, but my shallow
pocket forbade.&nbsp; One penny to see Bedlam was all I could
spare.&nbsp; Here I met with a variety of curious anecdotes, for
I stayed long, and found conversation with a multitude of
characters.&nbsp; All the public buildings fell under my eye,
which were attentively examined; nor was I wanting in my
inquiries.&nbsp; Pass where I would I never was out of the way of
entertainment.&nbsp; It is reasonable to suppose that everything
in London was new and wonderful to a youth who is fond of
inquiry, but has scarcely seen anything but rags and
dung-carts.&nbsp; Westminster Abbey, St. Paul&rsquo;s, Guildhall,
Westminster Hall, &amp;c., were open to view; also both Houses
(of Parliament), for they were sitting.&nbsp; As I had always
applied deification to great men, I was surprised to see a hawker
cram the twopenny pamphlets into a member&rsquo;s face, who,
instead of caning her, took not the slightest notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I joined a youth who had business in the Tower, in
hopes of admission; but the warders, hearing the northern voice,
came out of their cells, and seeing dust upon my shoes,
reasonably concluded I had nothing to give, and, with an air of
authority, ordered me back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Royal Exchange, the Mansion House, the Monument,
the gates, the churches, many of which are beautiful; the
bridges, river, vessels, &amp;c., afforded a fund of
entertainment.&nbsp; I attended at Leicester House, the residence
of Frederick, Prince of Wales&mdash;scraped acquaintance with the
sentinels, who told me, had I been half-an-hour sooner, I should
have seen the prince and his family take coach for an airing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I had walked 129 miles to London, I was upon my
feet all the three days I was there.&nbsp; I spent half a day in
viewing the west end of the town, the squares, the parks, the
beautiful building for the fireworks, erected in the Green Park,
to celebrate the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748.&nbsp; At St.
James&rsquo;s I accosted the guard at the bottom of the stairs,
and rather attempted to advance; but one of them put forward the
butt-end of his piece that I might not step over.&nbsp; At St.
James&rsquo;s, too, I had my pocket picked of a handkerchief,
which caused me to return home rather lighter.&nbsp; The people
at St. James&rsquo;s are apt to fill their pockets at the expense
of others.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&ldquo;Observing, in one of the squares, the figure of
a man on horseback, I modestly asked a bystander whom it
represented?&nbsp; He observed, in a surly tone,
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s strange you could see nobody else to ask
without troubling me; its George I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not forbear mentioning at night, to my landlord
at the &lsquo;Horns,&rsquo; the curiosities I had seen, which
surprised him.&nbsp; He replied, &lsquo;I like such a traveller
as you.&nbsp; The strangers that come here cannot stir a foot
without me, which plagues me to that degree I had rather be
without their custom.&nbsp; But you, of yourself, find out more
curiosities than I can show them or see myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday evening, April 13th, I set out with four
shillings for Nottingham, and stopped at St. Alban&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Rising the next morning, April 14th, I met in the street the
tailor with the muffled head, whom I had left near
Leicester.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! my friend, what are you still
fighting your way up?&nbsp; Perhaps you will reach London by next
Wednesday.&nbsp; You guessed within a week the first
time.&rsquo;&nbsp; He said but little, looked ashamed, and passed
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a melancholy day.&nbsp; I fell lame, from the
sinews of my leg being overstrained with hard labour.&nbsp; I was
far from home, wholly among strangers, with only the remnant of
four shillings.&nbsp; The dreadful idea operated in fears!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped at Newport Pagnell.&nbsp; My landlord told me
&lsquo;my shoes were not fit for travelling;&rsquo; however, I
had no other, and, like my blistered feet, I must try to bear
them.&nbsp; Next day, Monday, 15th, I slept at Market Harborough,
and on the 16th called at Leicester.&nbsp; The landlady had
carefully secured my knife, with a view to return it should I
ever come that way.&nbsp; Reached Nottingham in the afternoon,
forty miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had been out nearly nine days;&mdash;three in going,
which cost three and eightpence; three there, which cost about
the same; and three returning, nearly the same.&nbsp; Out of the
whole eleven shillings I brought four pence back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;London surprised me; so did the people, for the few
with whom I formed a connection deceived me by promising what
they never performed, and, I have reason to think, never intended
it.&nbsp; This journey furnished vast matter for detail among my
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was time to look out for a future place of
residence.&nbsp; A large town must now be the mark, or there
would be no <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>room for exertion.&nbsp; London was thought on between
my sister and I, for I had no soul else to consult.&nbsp; This
was rejected for two reasons.&nbsp; How could I venture into such
a place without a capital?&nbsp; And how could my work pass among
a crowd of judges?&nbsp; My plan must be to fix upon some market
town within a stage of Nottingham, and open a shop on the
market-day, till I should be better prepared to begin the world
at Birmingham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I therefore, in the following February, took a journey
to that populous place, to pass a propable judgment upon my
future success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fixed upon Southwell as the first step of elevation,
fourteen miles distant, a town as despicable as the road to
it.&nbsp; I went over at Michaelmas, took a shop at the rate of
20<i>s.</i> a-year, sent a few boards for shelves, tools to put
them up, and about two hundred weight of trash, which a
bookseller would dignify with the name of books (and with,
perhaps, about a year&rsquo;s rent of my shop); was my own
joiner, put up the shelves and their furniture, worth, perhaps,
20s., and in one day became the most eminent bookseller in the
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During this wet winter I had to set out at five every
Saturday morning (carrying a burthen of three pounds&rsquo;
weight to thirty), open shop at ten, starve in it all day upon
bread, cheese, and half a pint of ale; take from 1<i>s.</i> to
6<i>s.</i>, shut up at four, and by trudging through the deep
roads and the solitary night five hours more, arrive at
Nottingham by nine, carrying a burthen from three to thirty
pounds, where I always found a mess of milk porridge by the fire,
prepared by my valuable sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing short of a surprising resolution and rigid
economy could have carried me through this dreadful
scene.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Hutton did not despair; he lived to a
good old age, and was a wealthy man.</p>
<p>The life of Kelly, the London publisher, is full of
interest.&nbsp; Thomas Kelly was born at Chevening, in Kent, on
the 7th of January, 1779.&nbsp; His father was a shepherd, who,
having received a jointure of &pound;200 with his wife, risked
the capital first in a little country inn, and afterwards in
leasing a small farm of about thirty acres of cold, wet land,
where he led a starving, struggling life during the remainder of
his days.&nbsp; When only twelve years old, barely able to read
and write, <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>young Kelly was taken from school and put to the hard
work of the farm, leading the team or keeping the flock; but he
was not strong enough to handle the plough.&nbsp; The fatigue of
this life, and its misery, were so vividly impressed upon his
memory, that he could never be persuaded to revisit the
neighbourhood in after-life; and though at the time he
endeavoured to conceal his feelings from his family, the
bitterness of his reflections involuntarily betrayed his
wishes.&nbsp; He fretted in the daytime until he could not lie
quietly in his bed at night; and early one morning he was
discovered in a somnambulent state in the chimney of an empty
bedroom, &ldquo;on,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;his road to
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this, his parents readily consented
that he should try to make his way elsewhere, and a situation was
obtained for him in the counting-house of a Lambeth brewer.&nbsp;
After about three years&rsquo; service here the business failed,
and he was recommended to Alexander Hogg, bookseller, of
Paternoster Row.&nbsp; The terms of his engagement were those of
an ordinary domestic servant; he was to board and lodge on the
premises, and to receive &pound;10 yearly; but his lodging, or,
at all events, his bed, was under the shop counter.</p>
<p>Alexander Hogg, of 16, Paternoster Row, had been a journeyman
to Cooke, and had very successfully followed the publication of
&ldquo;Number&rdquo; books.&nbsp; In the trade he was looked upon
as an unequalled &ldquo;puffer;&rdquo; and when the sale of a
book began to slacken, he was wont to employ some ingenious
scribe to draw up a taking title, and the work, though otherwise
unaltered, was brought out in a &ldquo;new edition,&rdquo; as,
according to a formula, the &ldquo;Production of a Society of
Gentlemen: the whole revised, corrected, and improved by Walter
Thornton, Esq., M.A., and other gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s duties were to make up parcels of books for the
retail booksellers; and his zeal displayed itself even in
somnambulism; for one night, when in a comatose state, he
actually arranged in order the eighty numbers of
&ldquo;Foxe&rsquo;s Martyrs,&rdquo; taken from as many different
compartments.&nbsp; He spent all his leisure in study, and soon
was able to read French with fluency, gaining the proper accent
by attending the French Protestant School in Threadneedle
Street.&nbsp; The good old housekeeper, at this time his only
friend, was a partaker of all his studies; at all events, he gave
her the benefit of all the more amusing and interesting matter he
came <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>across.&nbsp; His activity, though it rendered the head
shopman jealous, attracted Hogg&rsquo;s favourable attention, and
the clever discovery of a batch of stolen works still further
strengthened the interest he felt in the serving-boy.&nbsp; The
thieves, owing to the lad&rsquo;s ingenuity, were apprehended and
convicted, and Kelly had to come forward as a witness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This was my first appearance at the Old Bailey; and as I
was fearful I might give incorrect evidence, I trembled over the
third commandment.&nbsp; How could I think, while shaking in the
witness-box, that I should be raised to act as her
Majesty&rsquo;s First Commissioner at the Central Criminal Court
of England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half of his scanty pittance of &pound;10 was sent home to aid
his parents; and as his wages increased, so did his dutiful
allowance.&nbsp; In this situation Kelly remained for twenty
years and two months, and at no time did he receive more than
&pound;80 per annum; and it is believed that when his stipend
reached that petty maximum, he defrayed the whole of his
father&rsquo;s farm rent.&nbsp; That he was not entirely
satisfied with his prospects is evident from the fact that, about
ten years after he joined Hogg, he accepted a clerkship in Sir
Francis Baring&rsquo;s office; but so necessary had he become to
the establishment he was about to leave, that his master
prevailed upon him to accept board and residence in exchange for
what assistance he might please to render over the usual
hours.&nbsp; After six weeks of this work, poor Kelly&rsquo;s
health began to suffer, and it was plain that he must confine his
labours to one single branch of trade.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thomas,&rdquo; said his master, sagaciously enough,
though, probably, with a view to his own interests, &ldquo;you
never can be a merchant, but you <i>may</i> be a
bookseller.&rdquo;&nbsp; This advice chimed in with his
inclination, if not with his immediate prospects, and Kelly
devoted himself to bookselling.</p>
<p>At length Hogg, falling into bad health, and desiring to be
relieved from business, proposed to Kelly that he should unite in
partnership with his son; but Kelly thought it better to start on
his own account.&nbsp; In 1809, therefore, he commenced business
in a little room in Paternoster Row, sub-rented from the
landlord, a friendly barber.&nbsp; For the first two years his
operations were confined solely to the purchase and sale of
miscellaneous books on a small scale, and the limited experiment
proved successful.&nbsp; Of Buchan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Domestic
Medicine&rdquo; he bought 1,000 copies in sheets, at a low price,
and having prefixed a short memoir of his author, and divided
them into <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>numbers, or parts, he went out himself in quest of
subscribers; and 1,000 copies of the &ldquo;New Week&rsquo;s
Preparation&rdquo; were treated in like manner, and with similar
success.&nbsp; Kelly lived to be Lord Mayor of London.</p>
<p>Mr. Routledge, the founder of the well-known publishing-house
of that name, commenced business by opening a little shop in
Ryder&rsquo;s Court, Leicester Square, for the sale of cheap and
second-hand books.</p>
<p>Few booksellers have done better than the Heywoods of
Manchester.&nbsp; Abel began life as a warehouse-boy, on the
scanty pittance of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a-week.&nbsp; John
Heywood, at the age of fourteen, found employment as a hand-loom
weaver.&nbsp; Within ten years his wages rose from 2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> a-week to 30<i>s.</i>, and when in receipt of this
latter sum he regularly allowed his mother 20<i>s.</i>
a-week.&nbsp; For some time he was with his brother, and then he
took a little shop.&nbsp; It has been truly remarked by Mr. Henry
Curwen, in his &ldquo;History of Booksellers,&rdquo; that the
career of the two Heywoods is a striking example of the labour,
energy, and success which Lancashire folk are apt to think the
true attributes of the typical Manchester man.</p>

120</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MONEY-MAKING MEN IN THE
PROVINCES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1875 a sensational paragraph
appeared in most of the daily papers, announcing the death of
&ldquo;an old Mr. Attwood,&rdquo; who was declared to have been a
bachelor, and &ldquo;the giver of all the anonymous &pound;1,000
cheques.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was further stated that he had given
away &pound;350,000 in this way&mdash;&pound;45,000 within the
last year; that he had died intestate, leaving a fortune of more
than a million sterling, and that a thousand-pound note was found
lying in his room as if it had been waste paper.&nbsp; The truth
of the matter, as we are informed by a connection of the family,
is this.&nbsp; Mr. Benjamin Attwood was a brother of Mr. Thomas
Attwood, who was well known forty years ago as a leader of the
Birmingham Political Union, and one of the first members for that
borough.&nbsp; He was not a bachelor, but a widower, and the
fortune which he has left is believed to be much less than the
above-named sum, though its exact amount is not yet known.&nbsp;
After making a competent fortune by his own industry, Mr.
Attwood, some time ago, inherited enormous wealth from a nephew,
the late Mr. Matthias Wolverley Attwood, M.P., and he determined
to dispose of this accession to his income by giving it partly to
his less prosperous kinsfolk, and partly to charitable
associations.&nbsp; He would often call at a hospital or other
benevolent institution, and leave &pound;1,000, asking simply for
an acknowledgment in the <i>Times</i>, and never allowing his
name to be published.&nbsp; In this way he distributed larger
sums than that mentioned in the original rumour.&nbsp; It would
be wrong to regard Mr. Attwood as an eccentric man.&nbsp; His
life was quiet, gentlemanlike, and unassuming, with no special
peculiarities, and his only motive for secret almsgiving was the
desire to do good in an unobtrusive manner.&nbsp; He was one <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>of those
truly charitable men who loved to do good without letting his
left hand know what his right hand did, and he would probably
have been better pleased had his secret been kept after his death
as well as it was during his life.</p>
<p>They are fortunate men these provincial Cr&oelig;suses, and
don&rsquo;t let the grass grow under their feet.&nbsp; In the art
of money-making they need learn nothing of Cockneys or Americans,
but perhaps might teach them something as to the way to get on in
the world.&nbsp; One of the most successful of this class was Sir
Richard Arkwright, the famous inventor and the improver of
cotton-spinning machinery.&nbsp; Sir Richard was born in 1732,
and married, first, Patience Holt, of Lancaster, and second,
Margaret Biggins, of Pennington.&nbsp; He was the son of poor
parents, and the youngest of thirteen children.&nbsp; He was
never at school; and what little he did learn was without
aid.&nbsp; He was apprenticed to a barber; and after learning
that wretched business, set up for himself as a barber in Bolton,
in an underground cellar, over which he put up the sign-board
with the curious wording, &ldquo;Come to the Subterraneous
Barber&mdash;he shaves for a Penny,&rdquo; painted upon it.&nbsp;
Carrying away, by his low prices, the trade from the other
barbers in the place, they reduced their prices to his
level.&nbsp; Arkwright then, not to be outdone, and to keep the
lead in the number of customers, put up the announcement of,
&ldquo;A Clean Shave for a Halfpenny,&rdquo; which, no doubt, he
found answer well.&nbsp; After a time he quitted his cellar, and
took to tramping from place to place as a dealer in hair.&nbsp;
For this purpose he attended statute fairs, and other resorts of
the people, and bought their crops of hair from girls, bargaining
for and cutting off their curls and tresses, and selling them
again to the wig-makers.&nbsp; He also dealt in hair-dye, and
tried to find out the secret of perpetual motion.&nbsp; This led
to mechanical pursuits; he neglected his business, lost what
little money he had saved, and was reduced to great
poverty.&nbsp; Having become acquainted with a watchmaker named
Kay, at Warrington, and had assistance from him in constructing
his model, he first, it is said, received from him the idea of
spinning by rollers&mdash;but only the idea, for Kay could not
practically tell how it was to be accomplished.&nbsp; Having once
got the idea, Arkwright set to work, and neglected everything
else for its accomplishment; and, in desperation and poverty, his
poor neglected wife, who could only see waste of <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>time and
neglect of business in the present state of affairs, and ruin and
starvation in the future, as the consequence, broke up his
models, in hope of bringing him hack to his trade and his duties
to his family.&nbsp; And who can blame the young wife?&nbsp; The
unforgiving husband, however, separated from her in consequence,
and never forgave her.&nbsp; His poverty, indeed, was so great at
this time, that, having to vote as a burgess, he could not go to
the polling-place until, by means of a subscription, some clothes
had been bought for him to put on.&nbsp; Having re-made and
pretty well completed his model, but fearful of having it
destroyed, as Hargreave&rsquo;s spinning-jenny had been by a mob,
Arkwright removed to Nottingham, taking his model with him.&nbsp;
Here, showing his model to Messrs. Wright, the bankers, he
obtained from them an advance of money on the proper condition of
their sharing in the profits of the invention.&nbsp; Delay
occurring in the completion of the machine, the bankers
recommended Arkwright to apply to Jedediah Strutt (ancestor of
the present Lord Belper), of Derby, who, with his partner, Reed,
had brought out and patented the machine for making ribbed
stockings.&nbsp; Strutt at once entered into the matter, and by
his help the invention was completed.&nbsp; Thus the foundation
of the fortune of the Arkwrights was laid, and thus arose their
cotton-mills, and their residence (Wellersley Castle) near
Matlock.&nbsp; Arkwright was knighted in the year 1786, and in
the same year was High Sheriff of Derbyshire.&nbsp; He died in
1792.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorneycroft, who realised an immense fortune in the
iron-trade, at the Shrubbery Works, near Wolverhampton, was the
son of a working-man, and himself educated to earn his bread by
the sweat of his brow.&nbsp; In his youth he proved himself a
most skilful and trustworthy servant to his employers in the
iron-trade; and when about twenty-six years of age commenced a
small business on his own account.&mdash;Mr. Thomas Wilson, whose
work, the &ldquo;Pitman&rsquo;s Pay,&rdquo; had a national
reputation, who died at Gateshead in 1858, at the ripe age of
eighty-four, after having achieved a large fortune, began life by
working in a colliery.&nbsp; At nineteen years of age he was a
hewer in the mine.&nbsp; At sixteen he had sought more congenial
occupation, in which he might profit by the little culture he had
won by the sacrifice of needful rest; but he failed in the
attempt, and retired to his darksome drudgery.&nbsp; In time he
got to be a schoolmaster; and <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>afterwards the humble pitman became
a merchant prince.&mdash;Andrews, a famous Mayor of Southampton,
passed the first years of his life in utter poverty, working as a
farm lad, at threepence a-day, from nine to twelve years of age;
then getting employment as a sawyer; next as a blacksmith; but
always with aspirations for something better.</p>
<p>The first Sir Robert Peel was the third son of a small
cotton-printer in Lancashire.&nbsp; Enterprising and ambitious,
he left his father&rsquo;s establishment, and became a junior
partner in a manufactory, carried on at Bury by a relative, Mr.
Haworth, and his future father-in-law, Mr. Yates.&nbsp; His
industry, his genius, soon gave him the lead in the management of
the business, and made it prosperous.&nbsp; By perseverance,
talent, economy, and marrying a wealthy heiress&mdash;Miss Yates,
the daughter of his senior partner&mdash;he had amassed a
considerable fortune at the age of forty.&nbsp; He then began to
turn his mind to politics; published a pamphlet on the national
debt; made the acquaintance of Mr. Pitt, and got returned to
parliament (1790) for Teignmouth, where he had acquired landed
property which the rest of his life was spent in
increasing.&nbsp; In Greville&rsquo;s journals we
read:&mdash;&ldquo;Grant gave me a curious anecdote of old Sir
Robert Peel.&nbsp; He was the younger son of a merchant; his
fortune very small, left to him in the house, and he was not to
take it out.&nbsp; He gave up the fortune, and started in
business without a shilling, but as the active partner in a
concern with two other men&mdash;Yates, whose daughter he
afterwards married, and another, who between them made up
&pound;6,000.&nbsp; From this beginning he left &pound;250,000
a-piece to his five younger sons, &pound;60,000 to his three
daughters, each; and &pound;22,000 a-year in land, and
&pound;450,000 in the funds to Peel.&nbsp; In his lifetime he
gave Peel &pound;12,000 a-year; the others &pound;3,000, and
spent &pound;3,000 himself.&nbsp; He was always giving them
money, and for objects which, it might have been thought, he
under-valued.&nbsp; He paid for Peel&rsquo;s house when he built
it, and for the Chapeau de Paille (2,700 guineas) when he bought
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his biography, Sir William Fairbairn describes the heroic
way in which he mastered the difficulties of early years, and
became famous.&nbsp; It really seems that there is something in
the air, or in the nature of the inhabitants, of the northern
districts of the kingdom, which has a tendency, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>more or
less, to make a man rise in the world.&nbsp; The poet tells us
how</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Caledonia, stern and wild,<br />
Is meet nurse for poetic child.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though, as to that, neither Burns nor Scott had much to do
with that part of Scotland we call stern and wild.&nbsp; But the
country may claim to do more for her sons.&nbsp; Every one of
them seems born with a thirst for getting on in the world, for
revolving not to be contented with that position in life in which
Providence has placed him; and thus it is, that when we come to
examine minutely into the lives of our heroes, industrial or
otherwise, we find that most of them were Scotchmen, or, more or
less, had Scotch blood in their veins.</p>
<p>Of this we have a remarkable illustration in the case of the
late Sir William Fairbairn, who was, moreover, a worthy
representative of a class of men to whom we owe, in a large
measure, the wealth and prosperity our country now enjoys.</p>
<p>William Fairbairn was born in the town of Kelso, in
Roxburghshire on February 19th, 1789.&nbsp; His father, Andrew,
was descended, on the male side, from a humble but respectable
class of small lairds, or, as they were called, Portioners, who
farmed their own land, as was the custom in Scotland in those
days.&nbsp; On the female side the pedigree may have been of
higher character, for Andrew&rsquo;s mother was said by him to
have claimed descent from the ancient border family of
Douglas.&nbsp; She was a tall, handsome, and commanding woman,
and lived to a great age.&nbsp; William&rsquo;s mother was a Miss
Henderson, the daughter of a tradesman in Jedburgh, and the
direct descendant of an old border family of the name of Oliver,
for many years respectable stock-farmers in a pastoral district
at the northern foot of the Cheviots.&nbsp; The lad was early
sent to school, and made fair progress in what may be called a
plain English education.&nbsp; He was fond of athletic exercises,
and one of his feats was to climb to the top of the mouldering
turrets of the old abbey at Kelso.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1799,
the position of the family materially altered.&nbsp; The father
was offered the charge of a farm, 300 acres, in Ross-shire, which
was to be the joint property of himself and his brother, Mr.
Peter Fairbairn, for many years a resident in that county, and
secretary to Lord Seaforth, of Castle Braham; and there, in an
evil hour, the family removed.&nbsp; <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>But it was there that young William,
who was compelled to make himself generally useful, first
exhibited his taste for mechanics.&nbsp; The father next became
steward to Mackenzie, of Allan Grange; and at the school at
Mullochy, which the boy attended, he describes the advantage
derived by himself and his brother from wearing Saxon costumes
instead of Tartan kilts.&nbsp; The master was a severe
disciplinarian, and he found English trousers very much in the
way of his favourite punishment.&nbsp; After two years the family
moved south, and William&rsquo;s father became steward to Sir
William Ingleby, of Ingleby Manor, near Knaresborough.&nbsp;
After a few months spent in improving himself in arithmetic, in
studying book-keeping and land surveying, William, being a tall
lad of fourteen, was sent to work at Kelso.&nbsp; About this time
the family were in much difficulty; but the father got a better
post at Percy Main Colliery, near North Shields, and his son
followed him there.&nbsp; Wages were very high, and the
demoralisation amongst the men was such as, Sir William tells us,
he never saw before or since.&nbsp; Pitched battles, brawling,
drinking, and cock-fighting, seemed to be the order of the
day.&nbsp; Among the pit lads boxing was considered a necessary
exercise.&nbsp; And Fairbairn tells us he had to fight no less
than seventeen battles before he was enabled to attain a position
calculated to insure respect.&nbsp; In March, 1804, he was put
into a better and more definite position by entering regularly on
a course of education as mechanical engineer.&nbsp; He was bound
apprentice to the millwright of the colliery for seven years, and
was to receive wages beginning with five shillings a-week, and
increasing to twelve.&nbsp; Sometimes, he tells us, with extra
work he doubled the amount of his wages, by which he was enabled
to render assistance to his parents.&nbsp; This, we take it,
shows the lad was a good one, and the bad manners of his mates
had not corrupted him.&nbsp; This appears still further when we
see how resolute were his efforts after self-improvement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I became,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;dissatisfied with the
persons I had to associate with at the shop; and feeling my own
ignorance, I became fired with ambition to remedy the evil, and
cut out for myself a new path of life.&nbsp; I shortly came to
the conclusion that no difficulties should frighten, nor the
severer labour discourage me in the attainment of the object I
had in view.&nbsp; Armed with the resolution, I set to work in
the first year of my <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>apprenticeship, and having written
out a programme, I commenced the winter course in double capacity
of both scholar and schoolmaster, and arranged my study as
follows:&mdash;Monday evenings for arithmetic, mensuration,
&amp;c.; Tuesday reading, history, and poetry; Wednesday,
recreation, reading novels and romances; Thursday, mathematics;
Friday Euclid, trigonometry; Saturday, recreation and sundries;
Sunday, church, Milton, and recreation.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this
noble course the young man persevered, in spite of the ridicule
of his mates.&nbsp; The battle thus manfully begun was fought
bravely to the last.&nbsp; He was aided in his studies by a
ticket, given him by his father, to the North Shields
Subscription Library; and by the same tender passion which turned
Quentin Mastys from a blacksmith into an artist.&nbsp; We quote
Sir William&rsquo;s account of his intellectual improvement
whilst making love to the lady whom, however, he did not
ultimately marry.&nbsp; During his courtship, he tells us,
&ldquo;I was led into a course of letter-writing, which improved
my style, and gave me greater facilities of expression.&nbsp; The
truth is, I could not have written on any subject if it had not
been for this circumstance; and my attempts at essays, in the
shape of papers which I had read with avidity in the
<i>Spectator</i>, may be traced to my admiration of this
divinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the enthusiasm of my first attachment, it was my
good fortune to fall upon a correspondence between two lovers,
Frederick and Felicia, in the &lsquo;Town and Country
Magazine&rsquo; for the year 1782, Nos. 3 and 4.&nbsp; This
correspondence was of some length, and was carried from number to
number in a series of letters.&nbsp; Frederick was the principal
writer; and although greatly above me in station, yet his
sentiments harmonised so exactly with mine, that I sat down at
Frederick&rsquo;s desk and wrote to my Felicia with emotions as
strong as any Frederick in existence.&nbsp; Frederick, by his
writing, was evidently a gentleman; and in order to prepare
myself for so much goodness as I had conjured up in Mary, I
commenced the correspondence by first reading the letter in the
magazine, and then shut the book for the reply, and to write the
letter that Frederick was supposed to have written.&nbsp; I then
referred to the book, and how bitter was my disappointment at
finding my expressions unconnected and immeasurably inferior to
those of the writer.&nbsp; Sometimes I could trace a few stray
expressions which I thought superior to his; but, as a whole, I
<a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>was
miserably deficient.&nbsp; In this way did I make love, and in
this way I inadvertently rendered one of the strongest passions
of our nature subservient to the means of improvement.&nbsp; For
three successive winters I contrived to go through a complete
system of mensuration and as much algebra as enabled me to solve
an equation, and a course of trigonometry, navigation, heights
and distances, &amp;c.&nbsp; This was exclusive of my reading,
which was always attractive, and gave me the greatest
pleasure.&nbsp; I had an excellent library at Shields, which I
went to twice a-week, and here I read Gibbon&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,&rsquo; Hume&rsquo;s
&lsquo;History of England,&rsquo; Robertson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;History of Scotland,&rsquo; &lsquo;America,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Charles the Fifth,&rsquo; and many other works of a
similar character, which I read with the utmost attention.&nbsp;
I also read some of our best poets, amongst which were
Milton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Paradise Lost,&rsquo; Shakspeare, Cowper,
Goldsmith, Burns, and Kirke White.&nbsp; With this course of
study I spent long evenings, sometimes sitting up late; but
having to be at the shop at six in the morning, I did not usually
prolong my studies much beyond eleven or twelve
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During those pursuits I must, in truth, admit that my
mind was more upon my studies than my business.&nbsp; I made
pretty good way in the mere operative part; but, with the
exception of arithmetic and mathematics, I made little or no
progress in the principles of the profession; on the contrary, I
took a dislike to the work and the parties by whom I was
surrounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The possession of tools, and the art of using them,
renewed my taste for mechanical pursuits.&nbsp; I tried my skill
at different combinations, and, like most inventors whose minds
are more intent upon making new discoveries than acquiring the
knowledge of what has been done by others, I frequently found
myself forestalled in the very discovery which I had persuaded
myself was original.&nbsp; For many months I laboured incessantly
in devising a piece of machinery that should act as a time-piece,
and at the same time as an orrery, representing the sun as a
centre, with the earth and moon, and the whole planetary system,
revolving round it.&nbsp; This piece of machinery was to be
worked by a weight and a pendulum, and was not only to give the
diurnal motions of the heavenly bodies, but to indicate the time
of their revolutions in their orbits round the sun.&nbsp; All
this was to be done in accordance with one <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>measure of
time, which the instrument, if it could be completed, was to
record.&nbsp; I looked upon this piece of machinery as a
perfectly original conception, and nothing prevented me from
making the attempt to carry it into execution but the want of
means, and the difficulties which surrounded me in the complexity
and numerous motions necessary to make it an useful working
machine.&nbsp; The consideration of this subject was not,
however, lost, as I derived great advantage in the exercise which
it gave to the thoughts.&nbsp; It taught me the advantage of
concentration and of arranging my ideas, and of bringing the
whole powers of the mind with energy to bear upon one
subject.&nbsp; It further directed my attention to a course of
reading on mechanical philosophy and astronomy, from which I
derived considerable advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding the means at my disposal much too scanty to
enable me to make a beginning with my new orrery, I turned my
attention to music, and bought an old Hamburgh fiddle, for which
I gave half-a-crown.&nbsp; This was a cheap bargain, even for
such a miserable instrument; and what with new bracing of catgut
and a music-book, I spent nearly a week&rsquo;s wages, a sum
which I could ill afford, to become a distinguished
musician.&nbsp; I, however, fresh rigged the violin, and with a
glue-pot carefully closed all the openings which were showing
themselves between the back and sides of the instrument.&nbsp;
Having completed the repairs, I commenced operations, and
certainly there never was a learner who produced less melody or a
greater number of discords.&nbsp; The effect was astounding; and
after tormenting the whole house with discordant sounds for two
months, the very author of the mischief tumbled to pieces in my
hands, to the great relief of every member of the
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an illustration of the benefit of learning a business well,
I will quote a paragraph from the &ldquo;busy hives around
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; After describing the large establishment of
Messrs. Kershaw, Leese, and Co., Manchester, the writer
adds&mdash;&ldquo;There is a moral to our sketch.&nbsp; Mr.
Kershaw, owner of a splendid warehouse, two factories, a cotton
lord, merchant prince, and senator of the realm, was once a poor
Manchester boy, and is not an old man now (1878).&nbsp; As he set
Manchester an example of good taste and wise magnificence, so he
stands an example to all young men of what untiring diligence may
achieve.&nbsp; He rose in his house of business because he
<i>learned his business </i><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span><i>well</i>.&nbsp; He waited not
upon fortune from without, but worked out his own future from
within.&nbsp; He became one of the many of the illustrious men
whom Lancashire points to as her pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who has not heard of Sir Titus Salt?&nbsp; His beneficence,
especially, has made him famous; his name is a veritable
household word.&nbsp; The founder of Saltaire is, in many
respects, no ordinary man.&nbsp; He is one of those who have
neither been born great nor had greatness thrust upon them.&nbsp;
He has achieved it, and achieved it worthily.&nbsp; Possessed of
large intellect, immense strength of mind, and remarkable
business acumen, he gained a princely fortune, and made himself
one of Yorkshire&rsquo;s chief manufacturers.</p>
<p>Sir Titus was born in Morley, near Leeds, on the 20th of
September, 1803.&nbsp; Some time after his birth, his father,
Daniel Salt, removed to Bradford, where he became an extensive
wool-dealer, and by-and-by took his son into partnership.&nbsp;
At once the young man&rsquo;s rare business qualities showed
themselves, and the speculations of the firm&mdash;now Daniel
Salt and Co.&mdash;grew larger than ever.&nbsp; Hitherto,
however, the Russian Donskoi wool&mdash;in which they dealt
extensively&mdash;had been used only in the woollen trade.&nbsp;
The young man saw that it would suit the worsted trade as well;
so he explained his views to the Bradford spinners, but they
would scarcely listen to him.&nbsp; They knew, said they, the
Russian wool was valueless to them.&nbsp; Young Mr. Salt was not
disheartened by this.&nbsp; Not he!&nbsp; To prove his theory, he
commenced as a spinner and manufacturer himself, and his fortune
was assured.&nbsp; The wants of his trade led him occasionally to
Liverpool; and it was on one of these visits that the scene took
place which Charles Dickens, in his own inimitable way, described
in &ldquo;Household Words.&rdquo;&nbsp; Says he:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A huge pile of dirty-looking sacks, filled
with some fibrous material, which bore a resemblance to
superannuated horse-hair, or frowsy elongated wool, or anything
unpleasant or unattractive, was landed in Liverpool.&nbsp; When
these queer-looking bales had first arrived, or by what vessel
brought, or for what purpose intended, the very oldest
warehousemen in Liverpool docks couldn&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; There
had once been a rumour&mdash;a mere warehouseman&rsquo;s
rumour&mdash;that the bales had been shipped from South America,
on &lsquo;spec.,&rsquo; and consigned to the agency of C. W. and
F. Foozle and Co.&nbsp; But even this <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>seems to have been forgotten, and it
was agreed upon by all hands, that the three hundred and odd
sacks of nondescript hair-wool were a perfect nuisance.&nbsp; The
rats appeared to be the only parties who approved at all of the
importation, and to them it was the finest investment for capital
that had been known in Liverpool since their first ancestors had
emigrated thither.&nbsp; Well, these bales seemed likely to rot,
or fall to the dust, or be bitten up for the particular use of
family rats.&nbsp; Merchants would have nothing to say to
them.&nbsp; Dealers couldn&rsquo;t make them out.&nbsp;
Manufacturers shook their heads at the bare mention of them;
while the agents of C. W. and F. Foozle and Co. looked at the
bill of lading&mdash;had once spoken to their head clerk about
shipping them to South America again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day&mdash;we won&rsquo;t care what day it was, or
even what week or month it was, though things of far less
consequence have been chronicled to the half-minute&mdash;one
day, a plain business-looking young man, with an intelligent face
and quiet reserved manner, was walking along through these same
warehouses in Liverpool, when his eye fell upon some of the
superannuated horse-hair projecting from one of the ugly dirty
bales.&nbsp; Some lady-rat, more delicate than her neighbours,
had found it rather coarser than usual, and had persuaded her
lord and master to eject the portion from her
resting-place.&nbsp; Our friend took it up, looked at it, felt at
it, rubbed it, pulled it about; in fact, he did all but taste it;
and he would have done that if it had suited his
purpose&mdash;for he was &lsquo;Yorkshire.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having
held it up to the light, and held it away from the light, and
held it in all sorts of positions, and done all sorts of
cruelties to it, as though it had been his most deadly enemy, and
he was feeling quite vindictive, he placed a handful or two in
his pocket, and walked calmly away, evidently intending to put
the stuff to some excruciating private torture at home.&nbsp;
What particular experiments he tried with this fibrous substance
I am not exactly in a position to state, nor does it much
signify; but the sequel was that the same quiet business-looking
young man was seen to enter the office of C. W. and F. Foozle and
Co., and ask for the head of the firm.&nbsp; When he asked that
portion of the house if he would accept eightpence per pound for
the entire contents of the three hundred and odd frowsy dirty
bags of nondescript wool, the authority interrogated felt so
confounded that he could <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>not have told if he were the head or
the tail of the firm.&nbsp; At first he fancied our friend had
come for the express purpose of quizzing him, and then that he
was an escaped lunatic, and thought seriously of calling for the
police; but eventually it ended in his making it over in
consideration of the price offered.&nbsp; It was quite an event
in the little dark office of C. W. and F. Foozle and Co., which
had its supply of light (of a very injurious quality) from the
old grim churchyard.&nbsp; All the establishment stole a peep at
the buyer of the &lsquo;South American Stuff.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
chief clerk had the curiosity to speak to him and hear the
reply.&nbsp; The cashier touched his coat tails.&nbsp; The
bookkeeper, a thin man in spectacles, examined his hat and
gloves.&nbsp; The porter openly grinned at him.&nbsp; When the
quiet purchaser had departed, C. W. and F. Foozle and Co. shut
themselves up, and gave all their clerks a holiday.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus Mr. Salt (afterwards Sir Titus) became the introducer and
adapter of alpaca wool; and in a few years his wealth was
enormous.</p>
<p>Seventeen years afterwards Mr. Salt left Bradford, the scene
of his great success.&nbsp; He saw with sadness that the great
Yorkshire town was becoming over-crowded, dirty, and smoky to a
degree, and he made up his mind that the condition of <i>his</i>
factory workers, at any rate, should be improved.&nbsp; Hence he
purchased a tract of land on the banks of the river Aire above
Shipley, and founded Saltaire&mdash;a true palace of
industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For in making his thousands he never
forgot<br />
The thousands who helped him to make them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new works were opened in 1853, when a grand banquet took
place, at which members of parliament, mayors, and magistrates
were present, besides between 2,000 and 3,000 of Mr. Salt&rsquo;s
workpeople, who had marched in procession from smoky Bradford to
the fair country he had chosen for their future labours.</p>
<p>Sir Titus was made a baronet in 1869, and some years
previously he held the position of president of the Bradford
Chamber of Commerce.&nbsp; He has also been chief constable,
magistrate, and parliamentary member for the Bradford borough,
the inhabitants of which have shown their appreciation of his
services and generosity by erecting a handsome statue to him.</p>

132</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ECCENTRIC MONEY-MAKERS.</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">CURIOUS</span> romance adds one more
instructive fact to point the moral of a miser&rsquo;s life, and
of &ldquo;the love of money.&rdquo;&nbsp; For many years past an
old man might have been seen carrying an old bag on his
shoulders, scraping up odds and ends from the gutter, and garbage
from the streets.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s home was in a London
suburb, a wretched room filled with rubbish&mdash;old pieces of
iron and brass, bits of string, &amp;c.&nbsp; Around the room
were tin deed-boxes, which some of his friends half suspected
must be possessed of properties of more or less value.&nbsp; The
wretched man lived on what he chanced to pick up by the way, or
what was given to him by the charitable, who thought him to be a
beggar.&nbsp; He used to attend one of our metropolitan hospitals
as an out-patient, receiving advice and medicine gratis.&nbsp;
This man died in the midst of squalid wretchedness and apparent
want.&nbsp; His friends at once proceeded to ransack the place in
search for his money; the deed-boxes proved to be
&ldquo;dummies,&rdquo; containing only strings and tapes, and for
some time the search proved fruitless.&nbsp; At last, however,
the old chair in which he used to sit was found to contain, in
the worn-out cushion, a bundle of most valuable securities,
amounting to &pound;60,000, and a will.&nbsp; This will, after
leaving &pound;100 each to his executors, devised all the residue
of his property to two institutions&mdash;one moiety to the Royal
Free Hospital, Gray&rsquo;s-inn-road, in which institution he
used to obtain advice and medicine gratis, as above; and the
other half to the Royal National Lifeboat Association.&nbsp; So
that these two useful institutions will receive &pound;30,000
each, and possibly more, as the result of this
&ldquo;miser&rsquo;s&rdquo; wealth!&nbsp; Search is being made
for further documents amid the heaps of rubbish that have been
allowed to <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>accumulate in the wretched man&rsquo;s attic.&nbsp; The
case constitutes a sad and melancholy illustration of this fallen
nature of ours, in one of its most afflicting forms of
eccentricity and madness.</p>
<p>In the case of the Dancers, we have it recorded that their
money-grubbing propensity was prominent in three generations of
the family.&nbsp; The grandfather, the father, and the children,
were all misers&mdash;the lot of them, Daniel Dancer, Esq.,
appears to have been the most distinguished.&nbsp; He lived on
the Weald of Harrow, where he had a little estate of about eighty
acres of rich meadow-land, with some of the finest oak timber in
the kingdom on it.&nbsp; Besides, there was a good farm belonging
to him, worth at that time, if properly cultivated, more than
&pound;200 a-year.&nbsp; One day, coming to London to invest
&pound;2,000 in the funds, a gentleman, who met him near the
Exchange, mistaking him for a beggar, put a penny in his
hand&mdash;an affront which, it is needless to say, the beggar
pocketed.&nbsp; In spite of the fact that his wretched abode was
often broken into, he made a great deal of money by his penurious
habits.&nbsp; It took many weeks to explore the contents of his
dwelling.&nbsp; As much as &pound;2,500 were found on the
dung-heap in the cow-house; and in an old jacket, carefully tied
and strongly nailed to the manger, was the sum of &pound;500 in
gold and bank-notes; &pound;200 were found in the chimney, and an
old teapot contained bank-notes to the value of &pound;500.&nbsp;
Lady Tempest and Captain Holmes, his heirs, were benefited by the
old miser&rsquo;s savings to the extent of about &pound;3,000
a-year.</p>
<p>Money is sometimes strangely made.&nbsp; For instance, there
is the case of Gully, who was M.P. for Pontefract in 1832.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was taken out of prison,&rdquo; writes Mr. Charles
Greville, &ldquo;twenty-five or thirty years ago by a gentleman
to fight Pierce, surnamed the Game Chicken.&nbsp; He afterwards
fought Belcher (I believe), and Gregson twice, and left the
prize-ring with the reputation of being the best man in it.&nbsp;
He then took to the turf, was successful in establishing himself
at Newmarket, where he kept &lsquo;a hell,&rsquo; and began a
system of corruption of trainers, jockeys, and boys, which put
the secrets of all Newmarket at his disposal, and in a few years
made him rich.&nbsp; At the same time he connected himself with
Mr. Watt, in the north, by betting for him; and this being at the
time when Watt&rsquo;s stable was very successful, he won large
sums of <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>money by his horses.&nbsp; Having become rich, he
embarked in a great coal speculation, which answered beyond his
hopes, and his shares soon yielded immense profits.&nbsp; His
wife, who was a coarse, vulgar woman, in the meantime died, and
he afterwards married the daughter of an innkeeper, who proved as
gentlewoman-like as the other was the reverse, and who was very
pretty besides.&nbsp; He now gradually withdrew from the
betting-ring as a regular blackleg, still keeping horses, and
betting occasionally in large sums.&nbsp; He ultimately bought an
estate near Pontefract, and settled down as a gentleman of
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the beggarly race of misers, the most notorious was Thomas
Cooke, born in the year 1726, at Clewer, a village near
Windsor.&nbsp; His father, an itinerant fiddler, got his living
by playing in alehouses and fairs, but dying while Thomas was an
infant, his grandmother, who lived near Norwich, took care of him
till he was able to provide for himself, at which time he
obtained employment in a manufactory where there were a number of
other boys who were paid according to the work they did.&nbsp;
These boys always clubbed some money from their weekly earnings
for the establishment of a mess; young Cooke, however, resolved
to live cheaper, and when the other boys went to dinner he
retired to the side of a brook, and made his breakfast and dinner
at one meal upon an halfpenny loaf, an apple, and a draught of
water from the running stream, taken up in the brim of his
hat.&nbsp; With the money thus saved, he paid a youth, who was
usher to a village schoolmaster, to instruct him in reading,
writing, and arithmetic.&nbsp; Arrived at years of maturity,
Cooke found employment at a Norwich warehouse as a porter.&nbsp;
There his sobriety and industry caused his master to make him a
journeyman, and raise his wages.&nbsp; Further, his master
finding that he wished for an appointment as an exciseman,
procured a situation for him near London, and he came to the
capital by the Norwich waggon with only eight shillings in his
pocket; but that is of little consequence.&nbsp; It is not money
that makes a man succeed in life, but the want of it.&nbsp; In
the world, a man who begins with money generally ends by losing
it.</p>
<p>Being appointed to a district, Cooke found there was great
delay, and some expense, before he could act as an exciseman; he
therefore took the situation of porter to a sugar-baker, <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>and, in
course of time, became a journeyman.&nbsp; Here he did not
neglect his appointment to the excise, but reserved sufficient
time to himself to give it every necessary attention.&nbsp; By
attending on the superior of the district in which he was to act,
and by the money he saved while in the service of the
sugar-baker, Cooke was at length enabled to assume the dignity to
which he had so long aspired.&nbsp; Being appointed to inspect
the exciseable concerns of a paper-mill and manufactory near
Tottenham, Cooke was exceedingly well pleased; for, being already
versed in some parts of the trade from the knowledge he had
acquired at Norwich, he was desirous of learning those secrets in
the trade to which he was still a stranger.&nbsp; During the time
he was officially employed in this concern, the master of the
paper-mills and manufactory died.&nbsp; The widow, however, by
the advice of her friends, carried on the business with the
assistance of the foreman.&nbsp; Cooke&rsquo;s knowledge of the
business, but particularly the regularity with which he rendered
his accounts to the Board of Excise, induced the commissioners to
continue him in the employ.&nbsp; In the meantime he took a
regular and exact account of sundry infractions of the laws,
which, either from design or inadvertence, were daily committed
in this paper manufactory.&nbsp; Having calculated the value of
the concern, and the several thousand pounds the penalties
incurred by frauds on the revenue would amount to, he seized the
opportunity of privately informing the widow, that the penalties,
if levied, would amount to more than double the value of all her
property, and expose her to beggary and the King&rsquo;s
Bench.&nbsp; He assured her that the frauds which had been at
different times committed were only known to himself, and
suddenly proposed marriage to her as the only means of insuring
his secrecy.&nbsp; The widow, no doubt, convinced of the truth of
the statement, and seeing in Cooke a man of comely countenance
and of good figure, gave him a favourable answer, but suggested
the propriety of deferring the marriage till the time allotted to
the mourning for her first husband had expired.&nbsp; Cooke
agreed to this delay, having taken care to obtain her consent and
promise on parchment.&nbsp; At length his marriage with this lady
took place, and Cooke became possessed of all her property, which
was very large, and particularly of the mills at Tottenham, which
were on a lease to her former husband.&nbsp; On the expiration of
the lease, he <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>applied to the proprietors for a renewal of it; but, in
consequence of a previous treaty, the premises were, to his great
mortification, let to another person.&nbsp; He next purchased a
large sugar concern in Puddle Dock, and, as he knew something of
the business, flattered himself that he would he able to add
rapidly to his already large fortune.&nbsp; Here he carried his
former habits of parsimony and abstemiousness to the utmost
extent.</p>
<p>At this time his artfulness and meanness seem to have quite
gained the upper hand.&nbsp; One of his plans was to have his
table well supplied by the generosity of other people.&nbsp; His
colloquial powers were admirable.&nbsp; In his latter days it was
his practice, when he had marked out any one for his prey, to
find his way, by some means or other, into the house, by
pretending to fall down in a fit, or asking permission to enter
and sit down, in order to prevent its coming on.&nbsp; No humane
person could well refuse admission to a man in apparent distress,
of respectable appearance, whose well-powdered wig and long
ruffles induced a belief that he was some decayed citizen of
better days.&nbsp; The host would soon learn that this was the
rich Mr. Cooke, the sugar-baker, worth &pound;100,000; and this
would lead to an introduction to the family, all of whom the
artful sugar-baker would pretend to admire, asking the fond mamma
particularly for their names all in writing.&nbsp; The parents,
of course, considered that there could be but one motive for
asking such a question, and the consequence was, as he pursued
the plan with a score or two of people, that so great was the
quantity of poultry, game, vegetables, and provisions of every
kind which used to be sent him, that it did not cost him in
housekeeping, for himself and his domestics, more than
fifteen-pence a-day on an average; but it was considered as great
extravagance when the expenses of a day amounted to as much as
two shillings.</p>
<p>Alas! however, in spite of all his parsimony, the sugar-baking
business did not pay.&nbsp; At the end of twelve months he found
himself considerably the poorer.&nbsp; This would never do; and
in order to discover the secrets of the trade to which he had
been a stranger, he was induced to invite several sugar-bakers to
dine with him, and, after plying them with plenty of wine, he put
questions to some of the younger and more unguarded of the trade,
who, in a state of intoxication, made the desirable
discoveries.&nbsp; His wife, astonished at his being so unusually
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>generous, expressed her apprehensions about the
expenses of the wine, but he told her he would suck as much of
the brains&mdash;his usual phrase&mdash;of some of the fools as
would amply repay him.&nbsp; His wife was as much a victim as any
one else.&nbsp; She died of a broken heart.&nbsp; After he had
retired from business, Cooke went to reside in Winchester Street,
Pentonville, where he cultivated his own cabbages on a plot of
ground which had been originally laid out for a garden.&nbsp; To
get manure for his cabbages he would sally out on moonlight
nights, with a little shovel and a basket, and take up the
horse-dung that had been dropped in the course of the day in the
City Road.&nbsp; He seldom passed by a pump without taking a
hearty drink.&nbsp; In his daily visits to the Bank, he regaled
himself at the pump near the Royal Exchange.&nbsp; He was in the
constant habit of pocketing the Bank paper, as he never bought
anything if he could get it for nothing.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Cooke&rsquo;s inordinate love of money, he was
fond of amusement.&nbsp; It was said of Gilpin&rsquo;s wife,
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Though
on pleasure she was bent,<br />
She had a frugal mind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems the same could be said of Cooke.&nbsp; For instance,
he was very fond of going to Epsom races.&nbsp; But these
excursions never cost him anything, for he always took care to
fasten himself upon some of those people whom he used to buoy up
with assurances of making them his heirs.&nbsp; Thus he had his
ride to Epsom in his friend&rsquo;s gig and back to town, his bed
during the time of the races, his meals, and every other
accommodation at the expense of his fellow-traveller, to whom,
for all this treating, he never had the generosity to offer so
much as a bottle of wine in return.</p>
<p>Cooke died as he had lived, a pauper in heart.&nbsp; To the
last he cheated everybody.&nbsp; In 1811, he took to his bed, and
sent for several medical men in the hope of obtaining some
relief; but all knew him so well that not one would attend,
except Mr. Aldridge, who resided close by.&nbsp; Cooke permitted
this gentleman to send some medicine.&nbsp; On his last visit the
old man very earnestly entreated him to say candidly how long he
thought he might live.&nbsp; Mr. Aldridge answered that he might
last six days.&nbsp; Cooke collected as much of his exhausted
strength as he could, raised himself in his bed, and, darting a
look of keenest indignation at the surgeon, exclaimed, <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>&ldquo;And
are not you a dishonest man, a rogue, a robber to serve me
so?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo; asked the doctor, with
surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, sir, you are no better than a
pickpocket to rob me of my gold by sending two draughts a-day to
a man that all your physic will not keep alive for above six
days.&nbsp; Get out of my house, and never come near me
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the last days of his existence he was
extremely weak, and employed his few remaining hours in arranging
matters with his creditors.&nbsp; Some short time before his
death, one of his executors observed to him that he had omitted
to remember his two servants in his will; the one who had served
him as his housekeeper and nurse faithfully for upwards of ten
years; the other who used to lead him about the streets,
particularly to the Exchange Pump, to regale himself, and who was
also a good nurse during the time she lived with him; but Cooke
answered, &ldquo;Let them be paid their wages to the day of my
death&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the gentleman
remonstrating on the very great injustice it would be not to
leave them something, all he could obtain was twenty-five pounds
for one and ten pounds for the other, and even from that
twenty-five, after his friend had left the room, he took the will
and struck out the word five.&nbsp; He treated Dr. Lettisom quite
as shabbily.&nbsp; In order to evince his gratitude, he told the
doctor that he would make an ample donation to any public charity
which he should recommend.&nbsp; After the doctor had taken the
pains to explain to him the objects of different charitable
institutions, Cooke fixed upon the Humane Society for the
Recovery of the Apparently Dead, intimating, at the same time,
the extent of his fortune, and confirming it by bringing his will
in his pocket, which he submitted to the doctor&rsquo;s
inspection.&nbsp; About three weeks before his decease, he
confidently assured Dr. Lettisom that, besides the ample
provision he had made for his numerous relatives and friends, and
his two maid-servants, and still more ample bequests to
almshouses, he was in possession of a surplus fund of
&pound;40,000 unappropriated, and desired the doctor to specify
such hospitals and dispensaries as he deemed most in want of
funds their support.&nbsp; The doctor gave himself an immense of
trouble in the matter, but all to no purpose, the will was read,
it was found that he had left but pounds to the Royal Humane
Society, and to the doctor, for all the trouble and plague he had
given him, a plain gold ring.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&ldquo;Thus lived and died,&rdquo; writes his
biographer, &ldquo;unpitied and unlamented, in the eighty-sixth
year of his age, and possessed of a property of &pound;127,205
Three per Cent. Consolidated Bank Annuities, a man whose life was
chequered with as few good actions as ever fell to the share of
any person that has lived to an advanced age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not often that money is made by gambling; yet now and
then this is the case.&nbsp; General Scott, the father-in-law of
George Canning and the Duke of Portland, was known to have won at
White&rsquo;s &pound;200,000, thanks to his notorious sobriety
and knowledge of the game of whist.&nbsp; The general possessed a
great advantage over his companions by avoiding those indulgences
at the table which used to muddle other men&rsquo;s brains.&nbsp;
He confined himself to dining off a boiled chicken, with
toast-and-water.&nbsp; By such a regimen he came to the
whist-table with a clear head, and possessing, as he did, a
remarkable memory, with great coolness of judgment, he was
enabled honestly to win the sum of &pound;200,000.&nbsp; If the
general was not an eccentric money-getter, he evidently got his
money in an eccentric way.</p>
<p>Equally successful was the millionaire Crockford, who was
originally a fishmonger, keeping a shop near Temple Bar.&nbsp;
His fortune was all made at his gambling-house in fifteen or
sixteen years.&nbsp; A vast sum, perhaps half a million, was
sometimes due to him; but as he won all his debtors were able to
raise, and gave credit, it was hard for men of fashion, fond of
play, to keep out of his lures.&nbsp; He retired in 1840, much as
an Indian chief retires from a hunting country when there is not
game enough left for his tribe; and the club, which bore his
name, tottered to its fall.&nbsp; It really seems that at that
time there were no more very high players visiting the
place.&nbsp; It was said that there were persons of rank and
station who had never paid their debts to Crockford up to
1844.</p>
<p>Morissey, the well-known American gambler, has passed
away.&nbsp; At one time he kept a small drinking-saloon of the
lowest character.&nbsp; So disreputable was the place that it was
closed by the authorities.&nbsp; Morissey was also a
prize-fighter.&nbsp; Drunken, brutal, without friends or money,
he came from Troy to New York to see what would turn up.&nbsp; At
that time an election was in progress; and elections were carried
by brute force.&nbsp; There was no registry law; and the <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>injunction
to vote early and vote often was literally obeyed.&nbsp; In such
a city, and at such a time, Morissey was in his element.&nbsp;
Having acquired a little money, he opened a place for play.&nbsp;
He became thoroughly temperate.&nbsp; He resolved to behave well,
to be sober, and not gamble.&nbsp; Those resolutions he carried
out.&nbsp; His house in New York was the most elegantly furnished
of any of the kind in the State; the table, the attendants, and
the cooking, were of the first order.&nbsp; He followed his
patrons to Saratoga, and opened there what was called a
club-house; judges, senators, merchants, bankers, millionaires,
became his guests: the disguise was soon thrown off, and the
club-house assumed the form of a first-class gambling-house at
the Springs.&nbsp; Horse-racing and attendant games followed, all
bringing custom and profit to Morissey&rsquo;s establishment; and
thus he amassed a large fortune, and died in the odour of
respectability which wealth confers.&nbsp; Morissey, as Congress
man, was not exactly a working member.&nbsp; When he first went
to Washington, Mr. Colfax hardly knew on which of the committees
of the House it would be best to put him; so he said, in a very
apologetic tone, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Morissey, I should be very glad
to oblige in regard to a great many old members, and all the best
places belong by right to them.&nbsp; Still, I will see what I
can do for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Mr. Speaker,&rdquo;
said the new member, &ldquo;I am pretty particular; but 1 will,
at any rate, tell you what I want.&nbsp; If there is a committee
that has no committee-room, never has any business sent to it,
and never meets, I should like to be put on the tail-end of that
committee.&nbsp; How does it strike you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
relieve me wonderfully,&rdquo; said Mr. Colfax.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will put you on the Committee of Revolutionary
Pensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another case of that rarity, a successful gambler, is thus
described in &ldquo;Sunshine and Shadow,&rdquo; in New
York:&mdash;&ldquo;A man lives in the upper part of this city,
and in fine style.&nbsp; He is reputed to be worth 500,000
dollars.&nbsp; He came to New York penniless.&nbsp; He decided to
take up play as a business; not to keep a gambling-house, but to
play every night as a trade.&nbsp; He made certain rules which he
has kept over thirty years.&nbsp; He would avoid all forms of
licentiousness, would attend church regularly on Sunday, would
avoid all low, disreputable company, would drink no kind of
intoxicating liquors, wine or ale, would neither smoke nor <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>chew, would
go nightly to his play as a man would go to his office or his
trade, would play as long as he won, or until the bank broke,
would lose a certain sum and no more; when he lost that he would
stop playing, and leave the room for the night; if he lost ten
nights, he would wait till his luck changed;&rdquo; and this
system he followed exactly, while tens of thousands around him
were carried away into irretrievable ruin.</p>
<p>As I write I see the report of a peculiar case heard in
Dublin, before Chief Justice Morris and a special jury; and, as
the <i>Times&rsquo;</i> correspondent informs us, some very
curious revelations were made in the course of the hearing.&nbsp;
The action was brought by a Mr. Kavanagh to recover &pound;7,000
on account of work and labour alleged to have been done by the
plaintiff in his capacity of manager to the defendant, a Mr.
Henry Lindsay, a bill-discounter, who, it was stated, did
business to the extent of &pound;20,000 to &pound;30,000 a month,
and who lived alone in a large house in a respectable street,
sleeping on a stretcher, and having bills on the house announcing
it as to be let, in order that he might avoid, as he actually
succeeded in avoiding, the payment of rates, on the plea that he
was merely caretaker of the house.&nbsp; It also came out that
defendant, who was advanced in years, had recently paid
&pound;5,000 to compromise an action for breach of promise of
marriage.&nbsp; So the old gentleman had a soft side after
all!</p>
<p>One of the great millionaires of France was Ouvrard, the
financier&mdash;a man sprung from a very humble origin, but of
great financial capacity.&nbsp; During his long career of
success, which lasted from the latter part of the last century
till 1830, he made and spent millions of money.&nbsp; He was
ruined by making large sales in the funds, under the expectation
that the government of Louis Philippe could not stand.&nbsp; He
was born in 1770; and his first operation, which consisted in
buying up all the paper made in Poitou and Angoumois, and
retailing it at an immense profit to the Paris booksellers, laid
the foundation of his fortune.&nbsp; He soon afterwards made a
contract for provisioning the Spanish fleet, which had joined the
French squadron in 1797, and made a net profit of
&pound;600,000.&nbsp; In 1800, he was supposed to possess a
million and a-half of English money.&nbsp; Soon after he had the
contract for supplying the French army in the campaign which
closed <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>with the battle of Marengo.&nbsp; His prosperity
continued for many years; and in 1812, the government owed him,
for enormous advances made by him, nearly three millions of
English money.&nbsp; He was
<i>Munitionnaire-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i> for the Waterloo
campaign; and, in 1828, contracted to supply the Duc
d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me with everything necessary for the entry
of the French army into Spain; but the misfulfilment of his
contract entailed heavy losses on him, and in 1830 he was
completely ruined.</p>
<p>No man was more reckless in his expenditure, nor more
magnificent in his manner of living.&nbsp; At the time of the
Directory, the <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> given by him were the theme of
the whole of Parisian society at that time.&nbsp; At his splendid
villa near Rueil, during the Empire, he was in the habit of
giving suppers to all the <i>corps de ballet</i> of the opera
twice a-week, and he used to send several carriages, splendidly
equipped, to bear away the principal performers when the
performance was over.&nbsp; There an enormous white marble bath,
as large as an ordinary-sized saloon, was prepared for such of
the ladies as, in the summer, chose to bathe on their
arrival.&nbsp; There a splendid supper was laid out, of which the
fair bathers and many of the pleasure-seekers of the day partook;
and, besides every luxury of the culinary art, prepared by the
best cooks in Paris, each lady received a donation of fifty
louis, and the one fortunate enough to attract the especial
notice of the wealthy host a large sum of money.&nbsp;
Mademoiselle Georges, the celebrated tragedian of that day, cost
him, as he was fond of relating, a large sum of money.&nbsp; He
had invited her to sup with him at his villa; but the very day
she was to come, a note informed him that she was compelled to
give up the pleasure of supping with him, as the Emperor Napoleon
had given her a rendezvous for the same time, which she dared not
refuse.&nbsp; Ouvrard was furious at this <i>contretemps</i>, and
he could not bear to yield the <i>pas</i> to <i>le petit
Bonaparte</i>, whom he had known as a young captain of artillery,
too happy to be invited to his house in the days of the
Directory; and under this feeling, with a hint to the lady that
she would find 100,000 francs served up at supper, he prevailed
on the actress to give the emperor the slip.&nbsp; The following
day the great financier received a summons forthwith to appear at
the Tuileries, and was ushered into the emperor&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; After walking once or twice up and down the room,
the great man turned <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>sharp round on his unwilling guest,
and, with his eagle eye riveted on Ouvrard&rsquo;s face, sternly
demanded, &ldquo;Monsieur, how much did you make by your contract
for the army at the beginning of the year?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
capitalist knew it was vain to equivocate, and replied,
&ldquo;4,000,000 francs, sire.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, sir, you
made too much; so pay immediately 2,000,000 francs into the
treasury.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Ouvrard, says old Captain Gronow, who
tells the story, immediately did&mdash;much, probably, to his
vexation and disgust.</p>
<p>Before the French Revolution, the largest fortunes in France
were possessed by the farmers of the revenue, or <i>fermiers
g&eacute;n&eacute;raux</i>.&nbsp; Their profits were enormous,
and their probity was very doubtful.&nbsp; It is related, that
one evening at Ferney, when the company were telling stories of
robbers, they asked their host, Voltaire, for one on the same
subject.&nbsp; The great man, taking up his flat candlestick, as
when about to retire, began&mdash;&ldquo;There was once upon a
time a <i>fermier g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>&mdash;I have
forgotten the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Bagot will case we see another illustration of the way
in which money is made, and the dissipation and extravagance to
which it leads.&nbsp; Mr. Bagot, a colonial adventurer, returned
to Ireland with the reputation of enormous wealth, and married
the daughter of a baronet.&nbsp; Paralysed as he was, a son was
born to him, which he disowned.&nbsp; The Bagot case ended in a
verdict setting aside the late Mr. Bagot&rsquo;s will, and
disinheriting the infant son, and thus Mrs. Bagot was in a
measure legally rehabilitated.&nbsp; The disclosures at the
trial, however, revealed a panorama of years of extravagance,
folly, and riot, which is, we trust, exceptional.&nbsp; The whole
story of the Australian millionaire, Mr. Bagot, is fraught with
details that can only disgust; and it would have been much better
if the public had been spared recitals which, however
entertaining to frivolous persons, can hardly serve any good
purpose by the extraordinary publicity they have now
gained.&nbsp; Should a new trial take place, a good deal of the
money must pass into the lawyers&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p>Not long ago the death was announced of M. Basilewski, the
Rothschild of Russia, which took place at St. Petersburg, at the
age of ninety-two.&nbsp; The deceased, who was the father of
Princess Souvaroff, was the owner of gold mines in Siberia, which
have already produced for him more than 100,000,000 of
francs.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>In
America, even literary men, if they have luck, make money.&nbsp;
It is reported of &ldquo;Josh Billings&rdquo; (Henry W. Shaw)
that he made more money than almost any American author by
persistent working of his peculiar vein of humour.&nbsp; Some
years he got as much as 4,000 dollars from a weekly newspaper for
exclusive contributions: he made 5,000 or 6,000 dollars by
lecturing, and had a profit from his almanack of 8,000 or 9,000
dollars more&mdash;18,000 to 20,000 dollars per annum.&nbsp; That
is five or six times as much as Emerson, Hawthorne, Lowell, or
Holmes had ever made.</p>
<p>One of the most marvellous careers in London is that of Baron
Grant, who commenced his city life as a clerk in a
wine-merchant&rsquo;s office in Mark Lane, and whose capacity in
the way of &ldquo;financing&rdquo; and &ldquo;promoting public
companies&rdquo; appears to have been unrivalled.&nbsp; Of course
he made himself many enemies; but that is the way of the
world.&nbsp; The men who are the first to fling stones at a
successful rival, and to call him hard names, are the men who
morally have no claim to be censors on the ground of higher
principle or superior virtue.&nbsp; It is thus the unlucky ones
revenge themselves on their luckier rivals.&nbsp; They are prone
to hit a man when he is risen in the world.&nbsp; Nowhere is
there more lack of charity, or more evil speaking of one another,
than in the circles where Mammon is king, and where the great
object of life is held to be the art of money-getting and
money-making.</p>
<h2><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MORE MONEY-MAKING
M.P.&rsquo;S.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> me, in this chapter, give the
first place to Samuel Plimsoll, a man who, if he made money,
spent it nobly, and deserved the peerage far more than many who
have been elected to that honour&mdash;at any rate, from the time
the Earl of Beaconsfield became Premier.&nbsp; He was down very
low in the social scale, and it is thus he writes of his noble
poverty and of his companions in misfortune, in that appeal on
behalf of our seamen, which stirred up the community as with the
voice of a trumpet, and actually forced parliament to
legislate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;to disparage the rich; but I think it may reasonably be
doubted whether these qualities are so fully developed in
them&rdquo; (he had been writing of the honesty, of the strong
aversion to idleness, of the generosity to one another in
adversity, and of the splendid courage of the working classes);
&ldquo;for notwithstanding that not a few of them are not
unacquainted with the claims, reasonable and unreasonable, of
poor relations, these qualities are not in such constant
exercise, and riches seem, in so many cases, to smother the
manliness of their possessors, that their sympathies become not
so much narrowed as, so to speak, stratified; they are reserved
for the sufferings of their own class, and also the woes of those
above them.&nbsp; They seldom tend downwards much, and they are
far more likely to admire an act of high courage, like that of
the engine-driver who saved his passengers lately from an awful
collision by cool courage, than to admire the
constantly-exercised fortitude and the tenderness which are the
daily characteristics of a British workman&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may doubt this.&nbsp; I should once have done so
myself; but I have shared their lot; I have lived with
them.&nbsp; For months and months I lived in one of the model
lodging-houses, <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>established mainly by the efforts of Lord
Shaftesbury.&nbsp; There is one in Fetter Lane, another in Hatton
Garden; and, indeed, they are scattered all over London.&nbsp; I
went there simply because I could not afford a better
lodging.&nbsp; I have had to make seven shillings and ninepence
halfpenny (three shillings of which I paid for my lodging) last
me a whole week, and did it.&nbsp; It is astonishing how little
you can live on when you divest yourself of all fancied
needs.&nbsp; I had plenty of good wheaten bread to eat all the
week, and the half of a herring for a relish (less will do if you
can&rsquo;t afford half, for it is a splendid fish), and good
coffee to drink; and I know how much, or rather how little, roast
shoulder-of-mutton you can get for twopence for your
Sunday&rsquo;s dinner.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t suppose I went there
from choice; I went from stern necessity (and this was promotion
too), and I went with strong shrinking, with a sense of suffering
great humiliation, regarding my being there as a thing to be kept
carefully secret from all my old friends.&nbsp; In a word, I
considered it only less degrading than spunging upon my friends,
or borrowing what I saw no chance of ever being able to pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what did I see there?&nbsp; I found the workmen
considerate for each other.&nbsp; I found that they would go out
(those who were out of employment), day after day, and patiently
trudge miles and miles seeking employment, returning, night after
night, unsuccessful and dispirited.&nbsp; They would walk
incredibly long distances to places where they heard of a job of
work, and this not for a few days, but for very many days.&nbsp;
And I have seen such a man sit down wearily by the fire (we had a
common room for sitting, and cooking, and everything), with a
hungry despondent look&mdash;he had not tasted food all
day&mdash;and accosted by another scarcely less poor than
himself, with&mdash;&lsquo;Here, mate, get this into thee,&rsquo;
handing him, at the same time, a piece of bread and some cold
meat, and afterwards some coffee; and adding, &lsquo;Better luck
to-morrow&mdash;keep up your pecker;&rsquo; and all this without
any idea that they were practising the most splendid patience,
fortitude, courage, and generosity I had ever seen.&nbsp; You
would hear them talk of absent wife and children
sometimes&mdash;there in a distant workhouse&mdash;trade was very
bad then&mdash;with expressions of affection, and the hope of
seeing them again, although the one was irreverently alluded to
as my old woman, and the latter as the kids.&nbsp; I <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>very soon
got rid of miserable self-pity there, and came to reflect that
Dr. Livingstone would probably be thankful for good wheaten
bread; and if the bed was of flock and hay, and the sheets of
cotton, that better men than I in the Crimea (the war was then
going on) would think themselves very lucky to have as good; and
then, too, I began to reflect, that when you come to think of it,
such as these men were, so were the vast majority of the working
classes; that the idle and the drunken we see about
public-houses, are but a small minority of them made to appear
more&mdash;because public-houses are all put in such places; that
the great bulk are at home; for the man who has to be up at six
in the morning can&rsquo;t stay up at night; he is in bed early,
and is as I found my fellow inmates. * * * Well, it was
impossible to indulge in self-pity in circumstances like these;
and emulous of the genuine manhood all around me, I set to work
again; for what might not be done with youth and health; and
simply by preparing myself rather more thoroughly for my business
than had previously been considered necessary, I was soon strong
enough to live more in accordance with my previous life, and am
now able to speak a true word for the genuine men I left behind,
simply because my dear parents had given me greater advantages
than these men had.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this confession we see the
secrets of Mr. Plimsoll&rsquo;s ultimate success&mdash;the better
education his parents had given him, and the courage infused into
him by the example of men lower down in the social scale.&nbsp;
Under these circumstances he again went to work, and the result
was fame and fortune.</p>
<p>The great railway king, Mr. G. Hudson, was, for a time, a
money-making M.P., who rose from the linendraper&rsquo;s shop at
York, to be the observed of all observers, the lion of the day,
to whom, while his money lasted, the oldest and the proudest
aristocracy in the world stood cap in hand.&nbsp; Alas! however,
he outlived his wealth.&nbsp; It took to itself wings, and flew
away.</p>
<p>The mother of Joseph Hume, M.P., kept a small crockery shop at
Montrose; and yet her son went out to India, made a large
fortune, and came back to his native land to be a distinguished
member of parliament, and a leader in political and economical
reform.</p>
<p>Mr. I. Holden, when M.P. for the eastern division of the West
Riding of Yorkshire, told a large meeting of the electors at
Leeds about his earlier years.&nbsp; &ldquo;I began life,&rdquo;
he said, <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>&ldquo;as an operative.&nbsp; I was a worker in a
cotton-mill, and when I had worked fourteen hours a-day, I spent
two in the evening school.&nbsp; I educated myself by that means
till I was able to continue my education by assisting in the
education of others; and I sometimes remember with intense
emotion, entering, upon a stage-coach, the town of Leeds,
unknown, and a perfect stranger, at twenty years of age, in order
to be the mathematical master in one of the first schools then in
Yorkshire, and almost one of the first in England.&nbsp; I spent
many happy months in the town of Leeds.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he
began to take an interest in politics, he watched the course of
the two great parties on the subject of Catholic emancipation and
the emancipation of the slaves, and became a Liberal.</p>
<p>Edward Baines, who became M.P. for Leeds, and the proprietor
of one of the most valuable newspaper properties in the kingdom,
the <i>Leeds Mercury</i>, set off to make his fortune in
1793.&nbsp; His son writes:&mdash;&ldquo;There was at that time
no public conveyance on the direct route from Preston to Leeds,
and the journey by coach, through Manchester, would have occupied
two days.&nbsp; The frugal apprentice, stout of heart and limb,
performed the journey on foot, with his bundle on his arm.&nbsp;
A friend accompanied him to Clithero; but he crossed the hill
into Yorkshire with no companion but his staff, and all his
worldly wealth in his pocket.&nbsp; Wayworn he entered the town
of Leeds, and, finding the shop of Messrs. Binns and Brown, he
inquired if they had room for an apprentice to finish his
time.&nbsp; The stranger was carelessly referred to the foreman;
and, as he entered the <i>Mercury</i> office, he internally
resolved that, if he should obtain admission there, he would
never leave it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he kept his word.&nbsp; A man
does what he wills.&nbsp; To succeed in life&mdash;to be even a
rich man or an M.P.&mdash;is mainly the result of the effort of
the indomitable will of a resolute and persevering man.</p>
<p>Mr. Baines succeeded because his maxim was, that what was
worth doing, was worth doing well.&nbsp; &ldquo;He laid the
foundations of future success,&rdquo; writes his son, &ldquo;as a
master, in the thorough knowledge and performance of the duties
of a workman.&nbsp; Whilst still receiving weekly wages, he
practised a prudent economy.&nbsp; He was anxious to improve his
condition, and he took the only effectual means to do it by
saving as much as he could of the fruits of his industry.&nbsp;
His tastes were simple, his habits strictly temperate, and his
companionships <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>virtuous.&nbsp; Always maintaining respectability of
appearance, he was superior to personal display.&nbsp; He lodged
with a worthy family; but on a scale of expense suited to his
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; An early marriage seems to have
increased his business energy.&nbsp; &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, and, when occasion required, at four or three,
was the young printer out of bed; and whatever neighbour rose
early was sure to find him in his office.&nbsp; He was above no
kind of work that belonged to his trade.&nbsp; He not only
directed others, but worked himself at case and press.&nbsp; He
kept his own books, and they still remain to attest the
regularity and neatness with which he kept them, though he had no
training in that department.&nbsp; Not a penny went or came but
had its record, either in his office or his domestic
account-books.&nbsp; In consequence, he always knew the exact
position of his affairs.&nbsp; His customers and friends steadily
increased; for it was found that he was to be depended upon for
whatever he undertook.&nbsp; With a spirit that stooped to no
meanness, but with a nature that cheerfully yielded all respect
and courtesy; with a temper as steady as it was sanguine and
happy; with constant prudence and unfailing attention to duty, he
won the confidence of every one that knew him.&nbsp; His
punctuality and method were exemplary; he conducted his business,
in all respects, in the best way.&nbsp; He not only took any
employment for his press, however humble, that came, but he
devised and suggested publications, and joined others in
executing them.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; adds the son, &ldquo;it was
necessary that energy in business should be seconded by economy
at home.&nbsp; He began by laying down the rule that he would not
spend more than half his income; and he acted upon it.&nbsp;
Great was his resolution, and many the contrivances to carry out
his purpose; but husband and wife being of the same mind,
assiduous and equally prudent, the thing was done.&nbsp; For some
time they kept but one servant.&nbsp; A main secret of his
frugality was, that he created no artificial wants.&nbsp; He
always drank water.&nbsp; He never smoked, justly thinking it a
waste of time and money to gratify a taste which does not exist
naturally, but has to be formed.&nbsp; He took no snuff.&nbsp;
Neither tavern nor theatre saw his face.&nbsp; The circle of his
visiting acquaintance was small and select.&nbsp; Yet he was not
an earth-worm.&nbsp; He took an active part in the Benevolent or
Strangers&rsquo; Friend Society, and was a man of public
spirit.&nbsp; The pure joys of domestic <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>life, the
pleasures of industry, and the satisfaction of doing good,
combined to make him as happy as he was useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that the foundation of Mr. Baines&rsquo;s
success in life, and of his eminent usefulness, was laid in those
homely virtues which are too often despised by the young and
ardent, but which are of incomparably greater value than the most
shining qualities&mdash;in integrity, industry, perseverance,
prudence, frugality, temperance, self-denial, and courtesy.&nbsp;
The young man who would use his harvest must plough with his
heifer.</p>
<p>If there is a passage in all his life of which his descendants
are and ought to be most proud, it is that lowly commencement,
when virtuous habits were formed; when the temptations of youth
were resisted; when life-long friendships were won; when domestic
life began in love, and piety, and prudence; when a venerable
neighbour, Mr. Abraham Dickinson, used to remark, &ldquo;Those
young people are sure to get on, they are so industrious;&rdquo;
and when the same good man said to a young friend at his
elbow&mdash;&ldquo;C&mdash;, thou seest an example in thy
neighbour Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rdquo; says the
proverb.&nbsp; It is true; yet it is also of immense importance
to begin well.&nbsp; Mr. Baines, some years since, was watching
an apprentice, whose habits were not steady, fold up a
newspaper.&nbsp; At the first fold there was a wrinkle, and at
every succeeding fold the wrinkle grew worse, and more
unmanageable.&nbsp; Mr. Baines said significantly to the
lad&mdash;&ldquo;Jim, its a bad thing to begin
wrongly.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor fellow found it so; for he soon
fell a victim to his vices.&nbsp; His master had begun right, and
every succeeding fold in life was easy and straight.&nbsp; The
lesson is worth remembering.</p>
<p>Another illustration of money-making is to be found in the
case of William James Chaplin, a native of Rochester, in Kent,
whose history affords a remarkable example of the way in which a
man rises from the humblest ranks, by talent and energy, to a
place amongst the most influential and wealthy men of the
day.&nbsp; Before railways were in operation, Mr. Chaplin had
succeeded in becoming one of the largest coach proprietors in the
kingdom.&nbsp; His establishment grew from small beginnings,
until, just before the opening of the London and North-Western
Railway, he was proprietor of sixty-four stage-coaches, worked by
1,500 horses, and returning <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>yearly more than a million
sterling.&nbsp; A man who could build up such a business was not
likely to let it sink under him; and, accordingly, we find that
he moved his large capital from four-horse coaches into railway
shares, and entered largely in foreign railways, especially in
France and Holland.&nbsp; His greatest stake, however, was
invested in the London and South-Western, of which he became
director, and afterwards chairman.&nbsp; In 1845, he was Sheriff
of London, when he took some pains to promote prison reform; and,
in 1847, was elected M.P. for Salisbury, as a supporter of free
trade and the ballot.&nbsp; He was also a deputy-lieutenant of
the county of Hants.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable careers was that of Mr. Lindsay,
M.P., who was a native of Ayre, in Scotland, where he was born in
1816, and left an orphan at six.&nbsp; When only fifteen years of
age he commenced his career, leaving home with three shillings
and sixpence in his pocket, to push his way as a sea-boy.&nbsp;
He worked his way to Liverpool by trimming coals in the coal-hole
of a steamer.&nbsp; Arrived in that great commercial emporium, he
found himself friendless and destitute, and seven long weeks
passed before he was able to find employment, four of which were
spent in such utter destitution that he was reduced to the
necessity of sleeping in the streets and sheds of Liverpool,
often eating nothing but what he begged for.&nbsp; At length he
was fortunate enough to be engaged in the <i>Isabella</i>, a West
Indiaman; and such were the hardships to which the cabin-boy of
that day was subjected, that, at times, it might almost be
questioned whether the change was for the better.&nbsp; But
William Lindsay was not a lad to be discouraged by
hardships.&nbsp; Pressing steadily onward, in 1834, three years
after he had first joined the ship in the humblest capacity, he
was appointed to the position of second mate; but even when
fortune had begun to smile upon him, her face was not altogether
unclouded; for in the same year he was shipwrecked, and had both
legs and one arm broken.&nbsp; The following year he was promoted
to be chief mate; and in 1836, in his nineteenth year, he was
appointed to the command of the <i>Olive Branch</i>, which seems,
however, so to have belied her name, that, being in the Persian
Gulf in 1839, in a hostile encounter, her commander was cut down
by a sabre-stroke across the breast, he at the same time killing
his assailant by a pistol-shot.&nbsp; <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>The following year Mr. Lindsay
retired from the sea, and, in 1841, was appointed agent for the
Castle-Eden Coal Company.&nbsp; He was mainly instrumental in
getting Hartlepool made an independent port, and rendered
material assistance in the establishment of its docks and
wharves.&nbsp; In 1845, he removed to London, and laid the
foundation of that extensive business which now entitles him to
recognition as one of the &ldquo;merchant princes&rdquo; of the
metropolis.&nbsp; Nor, amid all the bustle and occupation of a
busy life, did Mr. Lindsay lose sight of his mental
improvement.&nbsp; Devoting his spare evening hours, which
thousands waste in idleness or dissipation, to self-instruction,
he speedily overcame the defects of his early education, and
stored his mind with a variety of sound information, which has
been of essential service to him in his subsequent career.&nbsp;
In proof how profitably he employed these hours of study, it may
be stated that he has published various pamphlets and letters on
questions connected with the shipping interest, in which he
himself holds so large a stake; as well as a more important work,
entitled &ldquo;Our Navigation and Mercantile Marine
Laws.&rdquo;&nbsp; No sooner was his position as one of the
largest shipowners and shipbrokers in the kingdom achieved, than
he resolved to get into parliament.&nbsp; He contested Monmouth
in April, and Dartmouth in July, 1852, in both of which he was
beaten by aristocratic influence, and the unsparing use of other
means of corruption.&nbsp; Undaunted by these defeats, and
determined to succeed at last, even if twenty times defeated, and
to succeed, too, by purity and principle alone, he became a
candidate for Tynemouth in March, 1854, and, after a severe
struggle, was elected by a narrow majority of seventeen.&nbsp; In
1857, he was again elected without opposition.&nbsp; When engaged
in the contest at Dartmouth, Mr. Lindsay gave the electors an
account of his career and his commercial position, which shows,
in a striking light, the magnitude of the operations of a large
mercantile establishment.&nbsp; He then, it appeared, owned
twenty-two large first-class ships; and, as an underwriter, he
had, in his individual capacity, during the past year, insured
risks to the amount of &pound;2,800,000.&nbsp; In the conduct of
their extensive export trade, the firm of W. S. Lindsay and Co.,
of Austin Friars, ship and insurance brokers, of which he is the
head, had, during the same year, chartered 700 ships to all parts
of the world, but principally <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>in India and the Mediterranean, and,
as contractors, had shipped 100,000 tons of coals, and 150,000
tons of iron; whilst, as brokers, during the year of famine,
their operations extended to 1,000,000 quarters of grain.&nbsp;
Mr. Lindsay took part in the formation of the Administrative
Reform Association; and being present at the initiatory meeting
at the London Tavern, proposed one of the resolutions in an
amusing speech, in which he detailed his experiences connected
with the subject, both at home and abroad.&nbsp; In the hot
debates, occasioned by neglect and maladministration, on the
Crimean war, he became quite a man of mark in the House of
Commons.&nbsp; And after his retirement from parliament, he
published a valuable and expensive book on the &ldquo;History of
Shipping and British Commerce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with this subject must also be mentioned the
respected name of Mr. Brotherton, who used often to tell the
House of the time when he himself had been a poor factory lad,
but who died wealthy and universally lamented.</p>
<p>Sir Samuel Morton Peto, the constructor of many of the
greatest engineering works in the country, and who for many years
represented Norwich in parliament, worked for seven years as a
bricklayer, carpenter, and mason, under his uncle, Mr. Henry
Peto.</p>
<p>Sir Francis Crossley, M.P., also was born in very humble
circumstances, and acquired the enormous wealth of which he
became possessed by his own energy and enterprise.&nbsp; Halifax,
which he represented in parliament, and where his manufactory was
situated, bore witness to his liberality.</p>
<p>Another M.P. who sprung from the ranks was Mr. Joseph Cowen,
who represented&mdash;as his son still
represents&mdash;Newcastle-on-Tyne.&nbsp; Such was his integrity,
and patriotism, and perseverance, that no man was more respected
in parliament or out.&nbsp; Crowned with grey hairs, his tall,
muscular frame, and big head, denoted a more than average amount
of physical and mental strength.&nbsp; As a member of parliament,
he was noted for the regularity of his attendance.&nbsp; In this
respect he was unrivalled.</p>
<p>I have already written that the late Mr. Herbert Ingram, M.P.,
blacked the shoes of one of his constituents.&nbsp; He was born
at Boston, in Lincolnshire, and was then apprenticed to one of
his constituents.&nbsp; After completing the terms of his
indenture, Mr. Ingram moved to Nottingham, where he carried <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>on business
as printer, bookseller, and news-agent.&nbsp; Whilst a
newsvendor, he displayed, in a remarkable degree, that industry
and perseverance for which he became distinguished in
after-life.&nbsp; Two instances of his extraordinary attention to
business may be cited.&nbsp; There was, amongst his customers, a
gentleman who wanted his news very early, and Mr. Ingram, anxious
that the gentleman should not be disappointed, walked five miles,
and of course five miles back, to serve a single customer.&nbsp;
On one occasion he got up at five in the morning, and travelled
to London to get some copies of a paper because there was no post
to bring them, and being determined that his customers should
have the news.&nbsp; His industry had its reward, for he sold
above 1,000 copies of that paper in Nottingham; and it was from
his experience as a newsvendor, and in the sale of metropolitan
prints, that he thought of the speculation which was destined to
make his fortune.&nbsp; He used to notice that a very bad
wood-cut in an old number of a newspaper would make it sell; and
it occurred to him, that if he had a number of good engravings,
and put them in a paper, they would be likely to make it
sell.&nbsp; Accordingly, in May, 1842, an experiment was resolved
on, and the first number of the <i>Illustrated News</i> made its
appearance.&nbsp; His success was immense; but he had learned the
secret of it from his experience in the humble and laborious
calling of a newspaper vendor.&nbsp; Indeed, the very title of
the new journal was suggested by the fact that the most
illiterate of his customers had been in the habit of coming to
ask him for the London news: they did not care what he sold them
so long as he gave them the London news; and he wisely came to
the conclusion, as that name suited the poorest class, it would
suit all classes; and thus his sagacity reaped a rich reward, and
he became a famous as well as a wealthy man.&nbsp; It is thus the
House of Commons has become enriched by the brains of some of the
most successful money-makers of their time.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GEORGE MOORE, CITIZEN AND
PHILANTHROPIST.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1825, a country lad arrived in
London on the day before Good Friday.&nbsp; As he was born in
1806, he was about twenty years of age.&nbsp; He had served his
apprenticeship with a linendraper at Wigton, where his master did
not prosper, and the young man determined to come to London in
search of a fortune.&nbsp; It was a wearisome ride then from
Carlisle to London, and took the coaches at least a couple of
days; but it is a long journey that has no end to it.&nbsp; In
due time the coach reached the &ldquo;Swan with Two Necks,&rdquo;
in Lad Lane, Wood Street, and, after paying the coachman, the
young man from the country took up his residence at the
&ldquo;Magpie and Platter.&rdquo;&nbsp; As may be supposed, he
felt rather lonely, and did not know what to do with
himself.&nbsp; He was too much fatigued, besides, to look after a
situation; so on Good Friday, as he knew the Cumberland men held
their annual wrestling match on that day, he made his way to
Chelsea to observe the sports.&nbsp; When he arrived there he
found a young Quaker friend from Torpenbow, who had won the belt
at Keswick a few years before.&nbsp; The new-comer, inspired by
the event, entered his name as a wrestler.&nbsp; He was described
by some, who were present on the occasion, &ldquo;as very
strong-looking, middle-sized, with a broad chest, and
strongly-developed muscles;&rdquo; his hair was dark and curly,
and almost black; his eyes were brown, and glowed under
excitement to a deeper brown; his face was redolent of
health.&nbsp; The new-comer &ldquo;peeled&rdquo; and stepped into
the ring.&nbsp; The first man he came against was a little bigger
than himself; but he threw him so cleverly, that the questions
were asked on every side&mdash;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where does he come from?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;&nbsp; His name was soon
known; and as he wrestled again, and threw his man, he was hailed
with cries of, &ldquo;Weel done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he succeeded;
and though <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>beaten at length by a noted champion wrestler from
Cumberland, the young man from the country was hailed as the
winner of the third prize.&nbsp; His name was George Moore, and
it was thus he made his <i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</i> in London in
the year 1825.&nbsp; It is needless to say that he was recognised
by his countrymen, and treated to drink.&nbsp; It was the wish
that he should have another wrestling bout, and wagers were made
on the subject; but to the credit of George Moore it must be
stated, that when he saw some of the lads around him were taking
more drink than was good for them, he made up his mind not to
wrestle in the proposed match, and left his admirers indignant at
his decision.</p>
<p>On his return, Moore learned that the inn&mdash;indeed, the
very bed in which he had slept&mdash;had become notorious; for
Thurtell, the well-known murderer, had been taken from it by the
police some time before.&nbsp; Moore was horror-struck, and
determined to seek fresh lodgings.&nbsp; He was fortunate in
finding very suitable ones in Wood Street, and thence he set out
to find a situation.&nbsp; It was hard work the search.&nbsp;
People laughed at his north-country accent, and rustic air and
clothes.&nbsp; In one day he entered as many as thirty
linendrapers&rsquo; shops.&nbsp; &ldquo;The keenest cut of all I
got,&rdquo; Moore used to say, &ldquo;was from Mr. Charles
Meeking, of Holborn.&nbsp; He asked me if I wanted a
porter&rsquo;s situation.&nbsp; This almost broke my
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fortunately, Mr. Ray, of Flint, Ray, and Co.,
had heard of the arrival of the Cumberland lad; indeed, he had
been looking out for him, and he offered Moore &pound;30 a-year,
which the latter gratefully accepted.&nbsp; At that time Moore
gave no promise of being worth much more.&nbsp; His first
appearance is thus described:&mdash;&ldquo;On incidentally
looking over to the haberdashery counter, I saw an uncouth,
thick-set country lad, standing crying.&nbsp; In a minute or two
a large deal chest, such as the Scotch servant-lasses use for
their clothes, was brought in by a man and set down on the
floor.&nbsp; After the lad had dried up his tears, the box was
carried up-stairs to the bedroom where he was to sleep.&nbsp;
After he had come down-stairs he began working, and he continued
to be the hardest worker in the house until he left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moore family were not penniless.&nbsp; George Moore was
not one of the men who came to London with half-a-crown, and with
that half-a-crown swell out into Rothschilds.&nbsp; His father
was a man of ancient descent, though of moderate <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>means, and
was one of the old Cumberland statesmen&mdash;a race of landed
proprietors unfortunately fast vanishing away.&nbsp; His
godfather left him a legacy of &pound;100, and a hair-trunk
studded with nails.&nbsp; His mother, who was a statesman&rsquo;s
daughter, died when he was six years old.&nbsp; At eight the boy
was sent to school.&nbsp; The master was drunken and brutal, and
naturally the school was unattractive.&nbsp; Under a new master,
however, the lad did better.&nbsp; When twelve, his father sent
him to a finishing school at Blennerhasset, and he remained there
for a quarter, at an expense of eight shillings.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
master,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;was a good writer, and a superior
man&mdash;indeed, a sort of genius.&nbsp; For the first time I
felt that there was some use in learning, and then I began to
feel how ignorant I was.&nbsp; However, I never swerved from my
resolve to go away from home.&nbsp; I had no tastes in common
with my brother.&nbsp; I felt that I could not hang about half
idle, with no better prospect before me than of being a farm
servant.&nbsp; So I determined that I would leave home at
thirteen, and fight the battle of life for myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was while an apprentice that this feeling strengthened and
matured.&nbsp; Card-playing had been to him a snare; but he
conquered the temptation, and became all the better for the
struggle with inclination, which appears to have been sharp and
severe.</p>
<p>But let us return to Moore&rsquo;s London life.&nbsp; After he
had been six months at Grafton House, one day Moore observed a
bright little girl come tripping into the warehouse, accompanied
by her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the governor&rsquo;s wife and
daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;if
ever I marry, that girl shall be my wife;&rdquo; and he kept his
word.</p>
<p>In 1826, somewhat disgusted with the retail trade (especially
as, owing to a mistake of his own, his integrity had been called
in question by one of the customers, a lady of title), Moore
entered the house of Fisher, Stroud, and Robinson, Watling
Street, then the first lace-house in the City of London.&nbsp;
His salary was to be &pound;40 a-year, and he wrote word to his
father that he was now a made man.&nbsp; How came this to be
so?&nbsp; In the first place, Moore had earned a good character
at Grafton House; and, secondly, Mr. Fisher, the head of the
lace-house, was a Cumberland man.&nbsp; Provincial ties were
stronger half a century back in London than they are now; but be
that as it may, Moore had much to learn in <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>his new
place.&nbsp; He was inaccurate&mdash;he lacked briskness and
promptitude.&nbsp; Mr. Fisher blamed his stupidity; he said he
had seen many a stupid blockhead from Cumberland, but that he was
the greatest of them all.&nbsp; This censure seems to have done
Moore good.&nbsp; He set about educating himself.&nbsp; He was so
ashamed of his ignorance, that he actually went into a
night-school.&nbsp; It was at Fisher&rsquo;s that Moore met with
Mr. Crampton, afterwards his partner.&nbsp; The latter
writes&mdash;&ldquo;We became close companions.&nbsp; His friends
were my friends, and so intimate were we, that I seemed to merge
into a Cumberland lad.&nbsp; George was very patriotic.&nbsp; All
our friends were Cumberlanders; and though I was a Yorkshireman,
I was almost induced to feign that I was Cumberland too.&nbsp; I
was gayer than he, and he never failed to tell me of my
faults.&nbsp; He was a strong, round-shouldered fellow.&nbsp; He
was very cheerful and very willing.&nbsp; He worked hard, and
seemed to be bent on improvement; but in other respects he did
not strike me as anything remarkable.&nbsp; Among the amusements
which we attended together were the wrestling matches at St.
John&rsquo;s Wood.&nbsp; The principal match was held on Good
Friday.&nbsp; One day we went to the wrestling-field, and George
entered his name.&nbsp; The competitors drew lots.&nbsp;
George&rsquo;s antagonist was a Life-Guardsman, over six feet
high.&nbsp; I think I see Moore&rsquo;s smile now as he stood
opposite the giant.&nbsp; The giant smiled too.&nbsp; Then they
went at it <i>gat hod</i>, and George was soon gently laid on his
back.&nbsp; By this time he was out of practice, and I
don&rsquo;t think he ever wrestled again.&nbsp; Besides, he was
soon so full of work as to have little time for
amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this Mr. Moore became traveller to the firm, and
excelled, not only in increasing the business of his employers,
but in the shortness of time in which he performed his
journeys.&nbsp; He used afterwards to remark, that it was the
best testing-work for a young man before his promotion to places
of greater trust.&nbsp; At the inns which he frequented he was
regarded as a sort of hero.&nbsp; To show the energy with which
he carried on his business, it may be mentioned that on one
occasion he arrived in Manchester, and after unpacking his goods,
he called upon his first customer.&nbsp; He was informed that one
of his opponents had reached the town the day before, and would
remain there for a day or two more.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
said Moore, &ldquo;it is no use wasting my time with my <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>competitor
before me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He returned to his hotel, called some of
his friends about him to help him repack his stock, drove off to
Liverpool, commenced business next day, and secured the greater
part of the orders before the arrival of his opponent.&nbsp; It
was while travelling in Ireland that Moore met Groucock, then
travelling for a rival firm.&nbsp; They had a keen fight for
trade, and Moore succeeded in regaining a good deal of it for his
own firm.&nbsp; Groucock, convinced of Moore&rsquo;s value,
offered him &pound;500 a-year (he was only getting &pound;150
from Fisher) to travel for his firm.&nbsp; Moore&rsquo;s reply
was, &ldquo;I will be a servant for no other house than
Fisher&rsquo;s; the only condition on which I will leave him is a
partnership.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length Groucock gave way; and in
1830, at the age of twenty-three, Moore entered as partner in the
firm of Groucock, Copestake, and Moore.&nbsp; The firm was
originally established in 1825, and their first place of business
was over a trunk-shop at No. 7, Cheapside.&nbsp; In 1834, the
firm removed to Bow Churchyard.&nbsp; The capital contributed by
George Moore was &pound;670, supplied him by his father.&nbsp;
His line was to travel for the firm, which he did with increased
assiduity.&nbsp; Frequently he was up two nights in the week.</p>
<p>There are many amusing stories told of the way in which Moore
got his orders.&nbsp; A draper in a Lancashire town refused to
deal with him.&nbsp; The travellers at the hotel bet him five
pounds that he could not get an order, and Moore started
off.&nbsp; When the draper saw him entering the shop, he cried
out, &ldquo;All full, all full, Mr. Moore; I told you so
before!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said George,
&ldquo;you won&rsquo;t object to a crack?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
no,&rdquo; said the draper.&nbsp; They cracked about many things,
and then George Moore, calling the draper&rsquo;s attention to a
new coat which he wore, asked what he thought of it?&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a capital coat,&rdquo; said the draper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes; made in the best style, by a first-rate London
tailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The draper looked at it again, and again
admired it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;you are
exactly my size; it&rsquo;s quite new; I&rsquo;ll sell it
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the price?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Twenty-five shillings.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s very cheap.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a
great bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll buy it,&rdquo;
said the draper.&nbsp; George went back to his hotel, donned
another suit, and sent the great bargain to the draper.&nbsp;
George again calling, the draper offered to pay him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll book it;
you&rsquo;ve opened an account.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Moore had sold
the coat at a loss, but he was recouped by the <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>&pound;5
bet which he won, and he obtained an order besides.&nbsp; The
draper afterwards became one of his best customers.</p>
<p>On another occasion, a draper at Newcastle-upon-Tyne was
always called upon, many times without a result.&nbsp; He was
always full; in fact, he had no intention of opening an account
with the new firm.&nbsp; Mr. Moore got to know that he was fond
of a particular kind of snuff&mdash;rappee, with a touch of
beggar&rsquo;s brown in it.&nbsp; He provided himself with a box
in London, and had it filled with the snuff.&nbsp; When at
Newcastle he called upon the draper, but was met, as usual, with
the remark, &ldquo;Quite full, quite full, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Moore, &ldquo;I scarcely expected an
order, but I called upon you for a reference.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, by all means.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of
conversation George took out his snuff-box, took a pinch, and put
if in his pocket.&nbsp; After a short interval he took it out
again, took another pinch, and said, &ldquo;I suppose you are not
guilty of this bad habit?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo;
said the draper.&nbsp; George handed him the box; he took a pinch
with zest, and said through the snuff, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
very fine.&rdquo;&nbsp; George had him now.&nbsp; He said,
&ldquo;Let me present you with the box; I have plenty
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; The draper accepted the box; no order was
asked, but the next time George called upon him he got his first
order.&nbsp; No wonder Moore succeeded; and it was well he
did.&nbsp; Times were bad; and it was his opinion, that had he
been laid up for three months the firm would have stopped
payment.&nbsp; At the end of three years Moore was made equal as
a partner with the rest.</p>
<p>In 1840, after one refusal, Moore led his first love to the
altar; and in 1841 he partially abandoned travelling; but the
change from travelling to office-work at first materially told
upon his health.&nbsp; To remedy this he took to fox-hunting, and
went to America, partly on business and partly on pleasure.&nbsp;
One of the results of his visit to the great republic, was the
establishment of a branch of the firm at Nottingham, and the
erection of a lace factory in that town.&nbsp; After this he
became a director of the Commercial Travellers&rsquo; Benevolent
Institution, and one of the most ardent supporters of the
Cumberland Benevolent Society, and of the Commercial
Travellers&rsquo; Schools.&nbsp; From the first he was the
treasurer of the latter institution.&nbsp; His partners were glad
to see him thus employed.&nbsp; They called them his
safety-valves.&nbsp; His holidays were spent in Cumberland, a
county <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>for which his love was strong till the last, and to the
schools of which he was ever a liberal contributor.&nbsp; Indeed,
educational reform in that county may be said to be almost
entirely due to him.&nbsp; In 1852, Mr. Moore was nominated by
the Lord Mayor of London as Sheriff; but his time was so occupied
that he paid the fine of &pound;400 rather than serve.&nbsp; For
the same reason, also, he declined to be an alderman, though
twice pressed to fill that honourable post.&nbsp; He said,
&ldquo;I once thought that to be Sheriff of London, or Lord
Mayor, would have been the height of my ambition; but now I have
neither ambition nor the inclination to serve in either
office.&nbsp; To men who have not gained a mercantile position,
corporation honours are much sought after; but to those who have
acquired a prominent place in commerce, such honours are not
appreciated.&nbsp; At the same time, I am bound to say that I
have always received the most marked courtesy and consideration
from the corporation, even although I did not feel inclined to
join it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Smiles reprints this without note or
comment; but surely it betrays a spirit not to be
commended.&nbsp; Great city merchants might well be proud to
serve in such a corporation as that of London, not as a
stepping-stone for themselves, but as an honour of which the
proudest may well be proud.&nbsp; As regards parliament, that is
another matter.&nbsp; Mr. Moore always refused to be a candidate
for parliamentary honours, on the plea that parliament should be
composed of the best, wisest, and most highly educated men in the
country.&nbsp; In this respect it is to be regretted that a large
number of M.P.&rsquo;s are not of Mr. Moore&rsquo;s way of
thinking.&nbsp; In politics it may be mentioned that Mr. Moore
was a Moderate-Liberal, and a strong Free-Trader from the very
first.&nbsp; He was an ardent admirer of Lord John Russell, and
had much to do with his return for the City in 1857.</p>
<p>In 1854, Mr. Moore removed to his mansion in Kensington Palace
Gardens.&nbsp; &ldquo;Although,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I had
built the house at the solicitation of Mrs. Moore, I was
mortified at my extravagance, and thought it both wicked and
aggrandising, mere ostentation and vain show to build such a
house.&nbsp; It was long before I felt at home in it, nor did it
at all add to our happiness.&nbsp; I felt that I had acted
foolishly.&nbsp; But, strange to say, a gentleman offered to take
the house off my hands, and to give me 3,000 guineas
profit.&nbsp; I made up my mind to accept this offer; but my dear
wife had taken <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>such an interest in the house that we could not decide
to sell it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He accordingly declined the offer.&nbsp;
But the house-warming was at any rate characteristic.&nbsp; He
determined that the young men and women should be the first
guests, and accordingly they were, to the number of 300.&nbsp; A
second ball was given to all the porters and their wives, the
drivers, and the female servants, to the number of about
200.&nbsp; Afterwards they had, at different times, about 800 of
their friends and acquaintances to dinner.&nbsp; But this was
abandoned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Happiness,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Moore,
&ldquo;does not flow in such a channel.&nbsp; Promiscuous company
takes one&rsquo;s mind away from God and His dealings with men,
and there is no lasting pleasure in the excitement.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Moore did not long enjoy her new home; she died in
1858.&nbsp; At that time Mr. Moore had become a decidedly
religious man.&nbsp; He had a serious illness in 1850, which
seems to have had great effect, and more than ever he gave
himself up to philanthropic work&mdash;such as aiding in the
establishment of a Reformatory for Discharged Prisoners, of the
Royal Hospital for Incurables, of the London General
Porters&rsquo; Benevolent Association, and the Warehousemen and
Clerks&rsquo; School, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; At Kilburn he said,
&ldquo;If the world only knew half the happiness that a man has
in doing good, he would do a great deal more.&rdquo;&nbsp; George
Moore lived under the increasing consciousness of this every
year.&nbsp; He wrote in his pocket-book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What I spent I had,<br />
What I saved I lost,<br />
What I gave I have.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this time, Mr. Moore seems to have made special efforts for
the spiritual improvement of the young men and women in his
employment in London, and to have retained the services of the
Rev. Thomas Richardson as chaplain.&nbsp; And then, as was
natural, his thoughts reverted to his native county of
Cumberland, for which already he had done so much, and for which
he felt inclined to do much more on his becoming the purchaser of
the Whitehall estate, very near the parish of Mealsgate, in which
he was born.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore was a great beggar as well as a great giver.&nbsp;
With his friends he was often very abrupt.&nbsp; When he entered
their offices they knew what he was about&mdash;they saw it in
his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it now, Mr. Moore?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I am <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>on a begging expedition.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I knew
that very well.&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
for the Royal Free Hospital, an hospital free to all without any
letters of recommendation; I want twenty guineas.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a large sum.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, it is the sum
I have set down for you to give; you must help me.&nbsp; Look
sharp!&rdquo;&nbsp; The cheque was got, and away he started on a
fresh expedition.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, he met with rebuff
after rebuff from men rolling in wealth, who had never given a
farthing to a charitable institution.&nbsp; This sickened him for
the day.&nbsp; However, he would say, &ldquo;I must not be
discouraged.&nbsp; I am doing Christ&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In another way Mr. Moore was specially helpful.&nbsp; He was the
constant resort of young men wanting situations.&nbsp; If he
could not provide for them in his own warehouse, he endeavoured
to find situations for them among his friends.&nbsp; He took no
end of trouble about this business.&nbsp; After his young friends
had obtained situations he continued to look after them.&nbsp; He
took down their names and addresses in a special red book kept
for the purpose, and repeatedly asked them to dine with him on
Sunday afternoons.&nbsp; He usually requested that they should go
to some church or chapel in the evening.&nbsp; In his diary are
repeatedly such entries as the following; &ldquo;Dined twenty-two
of the boys that I had got situations for, besides the people
that were staying in the house.&nbsp; I never forget that I had
none to invite me to their homes when I first came to
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; How much good such kindness did it is
impossible to tell; for the want of it many a young man in the
City goes to the bad.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore&rsquo;s second marriage, in 1881, seems rather to
have increased than diminished his philanthropic zeal.&nbsp; A
wedding trip of two months in Italy and elsewhere was but a brief
interval of holiday, to be followed by still harder work in the
cause of his Lord and Master; and then came an illness which
rendered necessary for him more rest of brain and more healthy
exercise for his body.&nbsp; In his knowledge of London he was
unrivalled.&nbsp; He knew it by night as well as by day.&nbsp;
Many a time he went down to St. George&rsquo;s in the East and to
Wapping to look after the poor.&nbsp; He accompanied the City
missionaries into the lowest dens; and as he felt that the only
way of reformation was to get at the children, we cannot be
surprised to learn that in 1866 he became treasurer of the Field
Lane Ragged School, an institution <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>at that time sorely in need of
pecuniary help.&nbsp; But his happiest days were those he spent
at his Border tower at Cumberland.&nbsp; There the house was
always full of visitors, and there the poor were equally welcome
as the rich.&nbsp; There also, he loved to act the part of a
distinguished agriculturist and to preside at cattle shows.&nbsp;
His guests were very varied, and included bishops,
Scripture-readers, warehousemen, farmers, City missionaries,
Sunday-school children, pensioners, and statesmen.&nbsp; He
rejoiced in hunting; but all the while he looked after the homes
of the poor, and battled with the immorality which exists quite
as much in the country as in town.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore was a great lover of the Bible, and distributed it
by the thousand, far and near.&nbsp; He always insisted on its
being read in schools.&nbsp; When the Middle-class schools were
established in London, he offered a thousand pounds on condition
that the Bible was read there; but he refused to give it till he
found that actually such was the case.&nbsp; In the case of
Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, after Dr. Jacob&rsquo;s sermon on the
institution, he became an ardent reformer.&nbsp; As prime warden
of the Fishmongers&rsquo;, he distinguished himself by the vigour
of his speeches.&nbsp; When Paris was in want, and its people
destitute of bread, he flew to their relief; and no man was more
active in giving relief for the destitute when the
<i>Northfleet</i> was sunk.&nbsp; In 1872, he was proud to be the
high sheriff of his native county.&nbsp; Among his last public
works was to give a supper to the cabmen of London, and to attend
the funeral of Dr. Livingstone.&nbsp; And he died as he
lived&mdash;engaged in works of mercy.&nbsp; In November, 1876,
he left his grand mansion in Cumberland to attend a meeting of
the Nurses&rsquo; Institute in Carlisle.&nbsp; While he was
standing opposite the Grey Coat Inn, two runaway horses, which
had escaped from a livery stable, came galloping up.&nbsp; One of
them knocked Mr. Moore down.&nbsp; He was taken up
insensible.&nbsp; Sir William Gull was sent for; but from the
first there was no chance, and in twenty hours he was dead.&nbsp;
Great was the sorrow felt everywhere, and in London and Carlisle
public meetings were held for a George Moore memorial fund.&nbsp;
At that in London the Archbishop of Canterbury presided, and Mr.
Samuel Morley was one of the speakers.</p>
<p>Friend of the church as he was at all times, and especially
attached to the Evangelical clergy, in one thing he <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>differed
from them.&nbsp; &ldquo;The parsons,&rdquo; he once said to a
meeting of children at Wigton, &ldquo;will tell you a good deal
about money.&nbsp; They will tell you that it is the root of all
evil; but my opinion is that it is a good thing to make plenty of
money, provided you make a proper use of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such
was George Moore, and such were his views and works.&nbsp; We owe
to Dr. Smiles a biography of him, which is as interesting and
instructive as could well be imagined.&nbsp; It should be read by
all City young men; it should be in every City library.&nbsp; The
character therein portrayed ought to be studied, and revered, and
imitated in every home.&nbsp; Few of us can expect to realise his
wealth, but his example is one to be held up to every City
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who believe,&rdquo; says a writer in the
<i>Daily News</i>, &ldquo;that genius is great natural power
accidentally directed, may think that the career of the late Mr.
George Moore justifies the well-known definition.&nbsp; Mr.
Moore&rsquo;s name was very well known, not in England only, but
on the continent, by every one who was labouring to lighten the
misery of the poor.&nbsp; The philanthropic schemes to which he
gave the aid of his energy, his knowledge of men and of life, and
his money, were too many to be numbered here.&nbsp; The French,
in particular, cherish a grateful memory of his benevolent
activity, of the help he extended to the victims in the war of
1870.&nbsp; To many who only heard of Mr. Moore in his later
life, and in the full tide of his helpfulness and prosperity, it
may have been unknown that he was the maker of the fortune which
he distributed with a generous hand.&nbsp; The biography of him
by Mr. Smiles, which has just been published, is a very
interesting account of a career which began in a humble though
honourable estate, and ended by a singular accident in the
northern town where it may be said to have begun.&nbsp; The
history of &lsquo;Self-Help&rsquo; is not invariably
edifying.&nbsp; The chief end of man, after all, is not to get on
in the world, to make a great deal of money, and to have
paragraphs devoted to his glory.&nbsp; This is so far from being
the case that one has even to overcome a slight natural prejudice
against the strength which displays itself mainly in the
acquisition of a fortune.&nbsp; In almost every rank of life
leisure has its charms and good gifts, which a man who never
takes rest must miss.&nbsp; The subject of Mr. Smiles&rsquo;s
book escapes from the vulgar renown of the self-made by his
unselfishness.&nbsp; <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>His energy, his ceaseless labours in
his early life, were not the manifestations of a desire for
wealth and for advancement, but the natural expression of immense
natural strength of mind and body.&nbsp; When success was
secured, the same vigour spent itself in work for other
people&mdash;for the poor, the weak, the helpless, the
ignorant.&nbsp; Mr. Moore might have devoted himself to the joys
of the collector, of the sportsman, of the ambitious
<i>parvenu</i>.&nbsp; Instead of doing so, he made amusement and
enjoyment subordinate to work for the benefit of others.&nbsp; He
had not the hardness and narrowness of people whose career has
been one of victory over the natural pleasures and innocent
impulses of an indolent race.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I
ever came across any other self-made man who had so entirely got
the chill of poverty out of his bones,&rsquo; Dr. Percival wrote
to Mr. Smiles.&nbsp; His geniality and unselfishness soften the
edges of his iron will and determination.&nbsp; People may think
that so much of the material and force that make greatness, might
have been better employed in work of a nobler tone&mdash;in
science, literature, law, or art.&nbsp; Mr. Moore took the only
career that was open to him, the career that was most distinctly
in contrast with the pastoral life to which he was bred.&nbsp; He
had no education in his youth, none lay within his reach in the
Cumbrian valley where he was born.&nbsp; With the chances of Dr.
Whewell he might have been a Whewell.&nbsp; With an opening in
the East, he might have been, if not a Clive, a Meadows
Taylor.&nbsp; As it happened, the choice lay between the
existence of a farm labourer and that of a tradesman.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">ARTISTS AND WRITERS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Men</span> who are not supposed to be
mercenary often make a great deal of money.&nbsp; Most of our
artists rose from very humble beginnings.&nbsp; Turner was the
son of a hair-dresser.&nbsp; Wilkie was desperately poor; so was
Barry; and William Etty, that great colourist, was the son of a
baker in York&mdash;was bound apprentice, wholly against his
will, to a printer in Hull; but he released himself from the
shackles of so uncongenial a pursuit.&nbsp; He was greatly
self-taught, for the help he derived for a hundred guineas, as a
private pupil of Sir Thomas Lawrence, seems rather to have
baffled him with despair; yet he became the most surprising and
effective flesh-painter of his age.&nbsp; The nude style of his
figures has often been a topic of remark with a certain order of
critics.&nbsp; Etty himself was wont to say, &ldquo;&lsquo;To the
pure in heart, all things are pure.&rsquo;&nbsp; My aim in all my
great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lived, in 1849, to find all his great
works&mdash;130 pictures&mdash;in the great room of the Society
of Arts: he died that year.&nbsp; By the universal acclamation of
artists he is regarded as our English Titian, and some claim for
him a still higher place, for his canvases have not only the
wonderful colour of that master, but the splendour of Paul
Veronese.&nbsp; He died in his beloved and native city of York;
and the poor baker&rsquo;s boy, by his industry and genius, had
become the master of a considerable fortune.</p>
<p>Actors and actresses also have made much money.&nbsp; Amongst
the money-making men may emphatically be placed David Garrick,
who was fond of money, and careful about it to the last.&nbsp;
Some of our earlier circus people seem to have made much
money.&mdash;Batty was reputed to have died worth half a
million.&mdash;Ducrow gave himself extraordinary airs.&nbsp; When
<a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the
Master Cutler and Town Council of Sheffield paid Ducrow a visit,
with the principal manufacturers and their families, Ducrow sent
word that he only waited on crowned heads, and not upon a set of
dirty knife-grinders.&mdash;Philip Astley was born in 1742, at
Newcastle-under-Lyme, where his father carried on the business of
a cabinet-maker.&nbsp; He received little or no education, and
after working a few years with his father, enlisted in a cavalry
regiment.&nbsp; His imposing appearance, being over six feet in
height, with the proportions of a Hercules, and the voice of a
Stentor, attracted attention to him; and his capture of a
standard at the battle of Emsdorff made him one of the
celebrities of his regiment.&nbsp; While serving in the army, he
learned some feats of horsemanship from an itinerant equestrian
named Johnson, perhaps the man under whose management Price
introduced equestrian performances at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, and
often exhibited them for the amusement of his comrades.&nbsp; On
his discharge from the army, he was presented by General Elliot
with a horse, and thereupon he bought another in Smithfield, and
commenced those open-air performances in Lambeth which have
already been noticed.</p>
<p>After a time he built a rude circus upon a piece of ground
near Westminster Bridge, which had been used as a timber-yard,
being the site of the theatre which has been known by his name
for nearly a century.&nbsp; Only the seats were roofed over, the
ring in which he performed being open to the air.&nbsp; One of
his horses, which he had taught to perform a variety of tricks,
he soon began to exhibit, at an earlier period of each day, in a
large room in Piccadilly, where the entertainment was eked out
with conjuring and <i>ombres Chinoises</i>&mdash;a kind of shadow
pantomine.</p>
<p>Having saved some money out of these performances, Astley
erected his amphitheatre.&nbsp; At the same time he had to
contend with a fierce competition from what was then the Royal
Circus, which afterwards was called the Surrey Theatre.&nbsp;
Astley&rsquo;s, however, soon became the popular place of
amusement, and as such was visited and described by Horace
Walpole.&nbsp; The fame of the place received a further
illustration in the remark of Dr. Johnson, who, speaking of the
popularity of certain preachers, and the ease with which they get
a crowd to hear them, said, &ldquo;Were Astley to preach a sermon
standing on his head, or on a horse&rsquo;s back, he would
collect a <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>multitude to hear him, but no wise man would say he had
made a better sermon for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us now turn to a master of homely English&mdash;a man
whose name was, at one time, in every one&rsquo;s mouth, and an
author, whose books, at one time, every one read.&nbsp; His moral
works excel in descriptive power.&nbsp; In politics his savage
personalities encircle sarcasm; his faculty for inventing
national nick-names, and mastery of a Saxon style of inimitable
raciness, have given his writings historical reputation.&nbsp; He
has never been equalled among political writers in his capacity
of explaining what he understood.&nbsp; He was the first
journalist who called attention to the condition of the working
classes, I mean William Cobbett.</p>
<p>William Cobbett was born at Farnham, in Surrey, in 1776.&nbsp;
His father was a very poor farmer, who knew enough to teach his
boys to read, and had enough of intellectual originality to think
that the triumph of Washington in the American War of
Independence was just.&nbsp; William began as a mere child to do
something towards earning his own livelihood, and took great
delight in the flowers which, while weeding in great folks&rsquo;
gardens, he saw.&nbsp; When eleven years old, he heard some one
speak of the splendid flowers in the Royal Gardens at Kew.&nbsp;
Without a word of announcement, and with sixpence-halfpenny in
his pocket, he set off to seek employment in that irresistible
Paradise.&nbsp; When he reached Richmond his funds were reduced
to threepence, and he was very hungry.&nbsp; In a shop-window,
however, he saw the &ldquo;Tale of a Tub,&rdquo; price
threepence.&nbsp; Mind triumphed over body; he bought the tale;
and sat under a hay-stack reading it till he fell asleep.&nbsp;
He was delighted beyond measure with the piece, and continued to
read and re-read it for many years.&nbsp; The circumstance was
not of happy omen.&nbsp; Swift&rsquo;s terrible tale we should
pronounce to be as well-fitted to sap the moral and religious
principles of a lad as any book in the English language; and lack
of moral principle was the fatal defect of Cobbett throughout
life.</p>
<p>He found employment at Kew, and no doubt gloated over the
floral splendours which he had come to see; but he returned to
Farnham, and grew up in his father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He made
an appointment one day to meet some young friends and accompany
them to Guildford Fair; but coming upon the high road as the
London coach was passing in full career, <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>he made up
his mind on the spur of the moment to start for London.&nbsp; He
arrived at the foot of Ludgate Hill with half-a-crown in his
pocket.&nbsp; An honest hop-seller, who knew his father, took him
by the hand, and he found work as an Attorney&rsquo;s
clerk.&nbsp; He speaks with unlimited abhorrence of the roguery
he witnessed and the misery he endured in this place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No part of my life,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;has been
totally unattended with pleasure except the eight or nine months
I passed in Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; The office&mdash;for so the
dungeon was called where I wrote&mdash;was so dark that on cloudy
days we were obliged to burn candles.&nbsp; I worked like a
galley-slave from five in the morning till eight or nine at
night, and sometimes all night long. * * * When I think of the
<i>saids</i> and <i>so forths</i>, and the counts of tautology
that I scribbled over&mdash;when I think of those sheets of
seventy-two words, and those lines of two inches apart&mdash;my
brain turns.&nbsp; Gracious Heaven! if I am doomed to be
wretched, bury me beneath Iceland snows, and let me feed on
blubber; stretch me under the burning Line, and deny me Thy
propitious dews; nay, if it be Thy will, suffocate me with the
infected and pestilential air of a democratic club-room; but save
me, save me from the desk of an attorney!&rdquo;&nbsp; Anything
seemed better than this.&nbsp; William, acting again on the spur
of the moment, enlisted.&nbsp; For more than a year he did duty
at Chatham.&nbsp; Here he mastered grammar&mdash;an acquisition
which he always regarded as the basis of his fortunes.&nbsp; He
read also in a circulating library, swallowing enormous
quantities of useful or useless knowledge, and laying it up in a
memory of great tenacity.&nbsp; His father meanwhile was treated
by him with heartless neglect.&nbsp; The old man had been
offended by his running away, and appears to have made no effort
to release him from the bondage of the attorney&rsquo;s
office.&nbsp; When he enlisted, however, his father relented, and
wrote saying that the last hay-rick or pocket of hops at Farnham
would be sold off to buy his discharge.&nbsp; But William
vouchsafed no reply.</p>
<p>Cobbett&rsquo;s regiment was ordered to Canada, and he
accompanied it to St. John&rsquo;s, New Brunswick.&nbsp; Here his
conduct as a soldier was exemplary.&nbsp; His talent and activity
made him conspicuous, and he became sergeant-major, raised,
though he was still but about twenty, over the heads of thirty
sergeants.&nbsp; In 1791 the regiment returned to England, and he
procured <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>his discharge &ldquo;in consideration of his good
behaviour, and the services he had rendered his
regiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then occurred one of the most strange and
ambiguous episodes in his life.&nbsp; He lodged charges of
pecuniary defalcation against four of his late officers.&nbsp; A
day was appointed for their trial by court-martial.&nbsp; The
functionaries met, the accused were present, all was ready for
commencement, when it transpired that Cobbett was missing.&nbsp;
As he was the accuser, the trial was adjourned to a stated day in
order that an opportunity might be afforded him to appear.&nbsp;
The court again met; he was again absent; the accused officers,
accordingly, were acquitted.&nbsp; They made some show of a wish
to proceed against Cobbett, and what looks very like a feint of
arresting him in his refuge at Farnham.&nbsp; But the upshot was
that he escaped to France, and passed from France, when the
revolutionary atmosphere became too hot for him, to
America.&nbsp; Mr. Watson very properly devotes a good deal of
attention to these circumstances, and we are bound to say that we
agree with him in thinking that Cobbett was bribed with a good
round sum to suppress his charges.&nbsp; It was, of course, an
act of flagrant and base dishonesty; but there is nothing in
Cobbett&rsquo;s life to prove that he shrank from dishonesty, or
was superior to temptation.&nbsp; He was a most affectionate
husband and father, and many of his advices to young men and to
the poor are excellent.&nbsp; His talent was of a coarse kind,
but very great.&nbsp; His activity and indomitable spirit deserve
all admiration.&nbsp; He boasted, probably with truth, that he
had never passed an idle day.</p>
<p>Cobbett first distinguished himself in America by publishing a
fierce pamphlet against Priestley.&nbsp; He was soon a noted
political writer, taking the side of ultra-Toryism, and
denouncing with furious emphasis all that savoured of Radicalism
or Republicanism.&nbsp; His talent was indubitable; and as
vehement and able rhetoric on the Church-and-King side was then
in demand, he attracted attention.&nbsp; On returning to England,
he was welcomed by the authorities as an out-and-out Tory, and
became the most violent, uncompromising, and popular of writers
on the ministerial side.&nbsp; It is worthy of recollection that
William Cobbett had his windows broken by the mob for the
vehemence of his anti-popular utterances.&nbsp; According to his
own account he met Pitt at dinner in Mr. Windham&rsquo;s house;
and the fact is not impossible, so highly <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>did
ministers at that time prize the aid of any one who could fight
for them against the patriots.</p>
<p>By what steps it is needless to trace, Cobbett gradually
sidled round, and left the cause of the king for that of the
mob.&nbsp; His circumstances became embarrassed, and he fled to
America, leaving behind him debts to the value of upwards of
&pound;33,000.&nbsp; He resided at Long Island, near New York,
and continued to edit his <i>Register</i>.&nbsp; In a few years
the irrepressible giant&mdash;he stood six foot two, with
shoulders and chest and girth to match&mdash;returned to
England.&nbsp; He had once denounced Tom Paine as a miscreant
whom no words could blacken.&nbsp; He now brought Tom
Paine&rsquo;s bones with him, bent upon having a grand monument
built over them in England.&nbsp; In this instance he signally
misunderstood his countrymen.&nbsp; The dead man&rsquo;s bones
were laughed at, and declared to be those of an old nigger.&nbsp;
Cobbett proposed to sell 20,000 hair-rings at a sovereign
a-piece, with some of Paine&rsquo;s hair in each; and he was
reminded that when Paine died he was almost bald.&nbsp; Cobbett
had at last to shuffle the bones underground, no one knows
where.&nbsp; His own eloquence and sarcasm made him popular, and
procured him a seat in parliament.&nbsp; He was now the fiercest
of democrats.&nbsp; He assailed Protestantism and detested
ministers of religion.&nbsp; His quackery grew worse and worse
until he died in 1835.</p>
<p>Sir Francis Chantrey was a poor lad.&nbsp; He began his career
by being a carver on wood.&nbsp; Rogers used to
say&mdash;&ldquo;One day Chantrey said to him, &lsquo;Do you
recollect that about twenty-five years ago a journeyman came to
your house from the wood-carver employed by you and Mr. Hope, to
talk about these ornaments (pointing to some on a mahogany
sideboard), and that you gave him a drawing to execute them
by.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rogers replied that he recollected it
well.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Chantrey, &lsquo;I was that
journeyman.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Chantrey practised
portrait-painting both at Sheffield and after he came to
London.&nbsp; It was in allusion to him that Lawrence
said&mdash;&ldquo;A broken-down painter will make a very good
sculptor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1823, London society was much exercised on the subject of
literary gains.&nbsp; Miss Wynn writes in her &ldquo;Diaries of a
Lady of Quality&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I heard to-day from Mr.
Rogers that Constable, the bookseller, told him last May that he
paid the author of &lsquo;Waverley&rsquo; the sum of
&pound;110,000.&nbsp; To that may now be added the produce of
&lsquo;Red Gauntlet,&rsquo; and &lsquo;St. <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>Ronan&rsquo;s Well;&rsquo; for I fancy Quentin
Durward&rsquo; was at least printed, if not published.&nbsp; I
asked whether the &lsquo;Tales of my Landlord,&rsquo; which do
not bear the same name, were taken into calculation, and was told
they were, but of course the poems were not.&nbsp; All this has
been done in twenty years.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1803, an unknown Mr.
Scott&rsquo;s name was found as the author of three very good
ballads in Lewis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tales of Wonder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was his first publication.&mdash;Pope, who until now had
been considered as the poet who had made the most by his works,
died worth about &pound;800 a-year.&mdash;Johnson, for his last
and best work, his &ldquo;Lives of the Poets,&rdquo; published
after the &ldquo;Rambler&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dictionary&rdquo;
had established his fame, got two hundred guineas, to which was
added one hundred more.&nbsp; Mr. Hayward, in a note,
adds&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Waverley&rsquo; having been published in
1814, the sum mentioned by Constable was earned in nine years, by
eleven novels in three volumes each, and three series of
&lsquo;Tales of my Landlord,&rsquo; making nine volumes more;
eight novels twenty-four volumes, being yet to come.&nbsp;
Scott&rsquo;s first publication, &lsquo;Translations from the
German,&rsquo; was in 1796.&nbsp; During the whole of his
literary life he was profitably engaged in miscellaneous writing
and editing; and whatever the expectations raised by has
continued popularity and great profits, they were surpassed by
the sale of the collected and illustrated edition of the novels
commenced under his own revision in 1829.&nbsp; Altogether, the
aggregate amount gained by Scott in his lifetime, very far
exceeds any sum hitherto named as accruing to any other man from
authorship.&nbsp; Pope inherited a fortune, saved and speculated;
and we must come at once to modern times to find plausible
subjects of comparison.&nbsp; T. Moore&rsquo;s profits, spread
over his life, yield but a moderate income.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s
did not exceed &pound;20,000.&nbsp; Talfourd once showed me a
calculation, by which he made out that Dickens, soon after the
commencement of &lsquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rsquo; <i>ought</i> to
have been in the receipt of &pound;10,000 a-year.&nbsp; Thackeray
never got enough to live handsomely and lay by.&nbsp; Sir E. B.
Lytton is said to have made altogether from &pound;80,000 to
&pound;100,000 by his writings&rsquo;.&nbsp; We hear of 500,000
francs (&pound;20,000) having been given in France for
Histories&mdash;to MM. Thiers and Lamartine for example; but the
largest single payment ever made to an author for a book, was the
cheque for &pound;20,000, <i>on account</i>, paid by Messrs.
Longman to Macaulay soon after the appearance <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>of the
third and fourth volumes of his History, the terms being that he
should receive three-fourths of the net profits.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This note of Mr. Hayward&rsquo;s, it should be remembered, was
written in 1864.&nbsp; Macaulay cleared a fine sum by his
History, and so did the publishers.&nbsp; During the nine years,
ending with the 25th of June, 1857, Messrs. Longman disposed of
30,978 copies of the first volume of the History; 50,783 copies
during the nine years ending with June, 1866; and 52,392 copies
during the nine years ending with June, 1875.&nbsp; Within a
generation of its first appearance, upwards of 150,000 copies of
the History will have been printed and sold in the United Kingdom
alone.</p>
<p>It is to be questioned, when her life comes to be written,
whether any author has been more successful, in a pecuniary point
of new, than Miss Braddon, whose &ldquo;Lady Audley&rsquo;s
Secret&rdquo; at once placed her on the pinnacle of fame and
fortune, and yet she began the world as a ballet-girl.</p>
<p>Few Irishmen, in a literary and political point of view, did
better than the Right Hon. John Wilson Croker.&nbsp; In his
&ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo; Charles Mayne Young thus speaks of his
rise and progress:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I suspect few people now alive are aware of
the commencement of Croker&rsquo;s career in London.&nbsp; Horace
Smith, James&rsquo;s brother, and one of the joint authors of
&lsquo;Rejected Addresses,&rsquo; told me that he, his brother,
and Cumberland, formed the staff of the <i>Morning Post</i> when
Colonel Mellish was its sole proprietor.&nbsp; On a certain
quarter-day, when he was in the habit of meeting them at the
office and paying them their salary, he took occasion to pass
them unqualified commendation for the great ability they had
brought to bear upon his journal.&nbsp; He assured them that the
circulation of the paper had quadrupled since their connection
with it; &lsquo;but&mdash;but&mdash;that he was, nevertheless,
under the necessity of dispensing with their pens for the
future.&rsquo;&nbsp; The two Smiths were so utterly unprepared
for such a declaration, that they were tongue-tied.&nbsp; Not so
the testy Cumberland, who took care to make himself as clearly
understood as if he had been the veritable Sir Fretful
Plagiary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What,&rsquo; he asked his employer, &lsquo;the
d&mdash;l do you mean?&nbsp; In the same breath in which you laud
your servants to the skies, and express your sense of obligation
to them, you discharge them oven without the usual month&rsquo;s
warning!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&ldquo;Mellish, quite unmoved, replied&mdash;&lsquo;You
must know, good sirs, that I care for my paper, not for its
principles, but as an investment; and it stands to reason, that
the heavier my outgoings, the less my profits.&nbsp; I do, as I
have said, value your merits highly; but not as highly as you
charge me for them.&nbsp; Now, in future, I can command the
services of one man, who will do the work of three for the wage
of one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The deuce you can,&rsquo; said Cumberland.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He must be a ph&oelig;nix.&nbsp; Where, pray, may this
omniscient genius be met with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the next room!&nbsp; I will send him to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he left, a young man entered, with a well-developed
skull, a searching eye, and a dauntless address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So, sir,&rsquo; screamed out Cumberland,
&lsquo;you must have an uncommon good opinion of yourself!&nbsp;
You consider yourself, I am told, three times as able as any one
of us; for you undertake to do an amount of work, single-handed,
which we have found enough for us all.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
not afraid,&rsquo; said the young man, with imperturbable <i>sang
froid</i>, &lsquo;of doing all that is required of
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; They all three then warned him of the tact,
discretion, and knowledge of books and men required&mdash;of the
difficulties of which he must expect to find an enterprise of
such magnitude beset, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; They began then to
sound his depth; but on politics, belles lettres, political
economy, even the drama, they found him far from shallow.&nbsp;
Cumberland, transported out of himself by his modest assurance,
snatched up his hat, smashed it on his head, rammed snuff
incontinently up his nose, and then rushed by Mellish, who was in
the adjoining room, swearing, and saying as he left,
&lsquo;Confound the potato.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s so tough,
there&rsquo;s no peeling him!&rsquo;&nbsp; The tough potato was
John Wilson Croker.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Charles Dickens made a great deal of money, all the world
is well aware.&nbsp; That in the tale of &ldquo;David
Copperfield,&rdquo; a little of his childish life was outlined,
was known, or rather suspected; but till his life appeared, no
one had the least idea how low down in the world he and his
family were, and how much more creditable to him was his
rise.</p>
<p>If it is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth, Dickens
certainly had this advantage.&nbsp; We have seldom read a more
touching picture than that which is given of the life of the
neglected, untaught, half-starved boy at this time.&nbsp; It is
tragic and affecting enough in itself, but it is still more <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>impressive
as suggesting the possible lot of hundreds and thousands in this
great London of ours.&nbsp; The one boy, by means of marvellous
genius, forces his way to the front; but who is to tell the story
of the obscure multitude who perish in the struggle?&nbsp; What
imagination has ever pictured scenes as tragic as the following
experiences?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is wonderful to me how I could have been
so easily cast away at such an age.&nbsp; It is wonderful to me,
that even after my descent into the poor little drudge I had been
since we came to London, no one had compassion enough on
me&mdash;a child of singular abilities, quick, eager, delicate,
and soon hurt, bodily or mentally&mdash;to suggest that something
might have been spared, as certainly it might have been, to place
me at any common school.&nbsp; Our friends, I take it, were tired
out.&nbsp; No one made any sign.&nbsp; My father and mother were
quite satisfied.&nbsp; They could hardly have been more so if I
had been twenty years of age, distinguished at a grammar-school,
and going to Cambridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blacking warehouse was the last house on the
left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford-stairs.&nbsp; It was
a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river,
and literally overrun with rats.&nbsp; Its wainscotted rooms, and
its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming
down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and
scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and
decay of the place, rose up visibly before me, as if I were there
again.&nbsp; The counting-house was on the first floor, looking
over the coal-barges and the river.&nbsp; There was a recess in
it, in which I was to sit and work.&nbsp; My work was to cover
the pots of paste-blacking; first, with a piece of oilpaper, and
then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string;
and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it
looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary&rsquo;s
shop.&nbsp; When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained
this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label;
and then go on again with more pots.&nbsp; Two or three other
boys were kept at similar duty down stairs on similar
wages.&nbsp; One of them came up, in a ragged apron and paper
cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using
the string and tying the knot.&nbsp; His name was Bob Fagin; and
I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in
&lsquo;Oliver Twist.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>&ldquo;Our relative had kindly arranged to teach me
something in the dinner-hour&mdash;from twelve to one, I think it
was&mdash;every day.&nbsp; But an arrangement so incompatible
with counting-house business soon died away, from no fault of his
or mine; and for the same reason, my small work-table, and my
grosses of pots, my papers, string, scissors, paste-pot, and
labels, by little and little, vanished out of the recess in the
counting-house, and kept company with the other small
work-tables, grosses of pots, papers, string, scissors, and
paste-pots, down stairs.&nbsp; It was not long before Bob Fagin
and I, and another boy whose name was Paul Green, but who was
currently believed to have been christened Poll (a belief which I
transferred, long afterwards, again to Mr. Sweedlepipe, in
&lsquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rsquo;), worked generally side by
side.&nbsp; Bob Fagin was an orphan, and lived with his
brother-in law, a waterman.&nbsp; Poll Green&rsquo;s father had
the additional distinction of being a fireman, and was employed
at Drury-lane Theatre; where another relation of Poll&rsquo;s, I
think his little sister, did imps in the pantomimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I
sank into this companionship; compared these every-day associates
with those of my happier childhood; and felt my early hopes of
growing up to be a learned and distinguished man, crushed in my
breast.&nbsp; The deep remembrance of the sense I had of being
utterly neglected and hopeless&mdash;of the shame I felt in my
position&mdash;of the misery it was to my young heart to believe
that, day by day, what I had learned, and thought, and delighted
in, and raised my fancy and my emulation up by, was passing away
from me, never to be brought back any more&mdash;cannot be
written.&nbsp; My whole nature was so penetrated with the grief
and humiliation of such considerations, that even now, famous and
caressed and happy, I often forget in my dreams that I have a
dear wife and children&mdash;even that I am a man&mdash;and
wander desolately back to that time of my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and my brothers and sisters (excepting Fanny
in the Royal Academy of Music) were still encamped, with a young
servant-girl from Chatham workhouse, in the two parlours in the
emptied house in Gower Street North.&nbsp; It was a long way to
go and return within the dinner-hour; and, usually, I either
carried my dinner with me, or went and bought it at some
neighbouring shop.&nbsp; In the latter case it <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>was
commonly a saveloy and a penny loaf; sometimes, a four-penny
plate of beef from a cook&rsquo;s shop; sometimes a plate of
bread and cheese, and a glass of beer, from a miserable old
public-house over the way&mdash;the &lsquo;Swan,&rsquo; if I
remember right, or the &lsquo;Swan&rsquo; and something else that
I have forgotten.&nbsp; Once I remember tucking my own bread
(which I had brought from home in the morning) under my arm,
wrapped up in a piece of paper like a book, and going into the
best dining-room in Johnson&rsquo;s alamode-beef-house in Charles
Court, Drury Lane, and magnificently ordering a small plate of
alamode-beef to eat with it.&nbsp; What the waiter thought of
such a strange little apparition, coming in all alone, I
don&rsquo;t know; but I can see him now, staring at me as I ate
my dinner, and bringing up the other waiter to look.&nbsp; I gave
him a halfpenny, and I wish, now, that he hadn&rsquo;t taken
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was thus Dickens was trained to fight the battle of
life.&nbsp; After this one feels inclined to say, &ldquo;How
great are the blessings of poverty!&rdquo;&nbsp; What an impulse
it gives the man to raise himself above it, somehow or
other.&nbsp; Hazlitt used to say that &ldquo;the want of money
often places a man in a very ridiculous position.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is no doubt about that.&nbsp; It is also equally clear,
that, without money, there can be little comfort, little
independence of thought or action, little real manliness.&nbsp;
Poverty is a wonderful tonic.&nbsp; Volumes might be written in
its praise.&nbsp; Almost all the wonderful things that have been
done in the world have been accomplished by men who were born and
bred in poverty.&nbsp; She is the nurse of genius, the mother of
heroes.&nbsp; She has garlanded the world with gold.&nbsp; Luxury
and wealth have ever been the ruin alike of individuals and
nations.&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s greatest benefactors have been
the money-getting men.&nbsp; Of course there are a few
exceptions; but they are the exceptions that confirm the
rule.</p>

179</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">REFLECTIONS ON MONEY-MAKING.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have little faith in
reflections.&nbsp; If a man cannot draw an inference for himself,
it is little use anyone attempting to draw it for him.&nbsp; The
reader of the preceding pages must have been taught, by example,
how to get money.&nbsp; The art of money-making is a very simple
one.&nbsp; If your income is twenty pounds, and you spend
nineteen pounds, nineteen shillings, and
elevenpence-three-farthings, you will never be troubled about
money matters; and, in the course of years, may have a fortune
commensurate with so modest an expenditure.&nbsp; Having thus
acquired a small amount of capital, you must not part with it to
mining-brokers or stock-brokers, however plausible the tale they
tell, and however friendly you may be with them.&nbsp; They are
bound to do business, and for the sake of that, will help their
nearest friend to an investment of the rottenest character.&nbsp;
Stock-brokers may have a sense of honour&mdash;may be gentlemen;
but I question much whether a money-broker has any feeling for
his clients, I have known little money made by outsiders
speculating on the Stock Exchange or in mines.&nbsp; I have known
many reduced to beggary and want by such means.</p>
<p>Commerce, in our day, is the high road to wealth.&nbsp; You
must begin at the bottom, and work your way up to the top.&nbsp;
It is not talent that makes a man succeed in business, but the
intense determination which carries a man through every obstacle
till the desired end is attained.&nbsp; It was thus George Moore
became a great man.&nbsp; The first elements in his character
were simplicity and directness.&nbsp; He was prompt, energetic,
precise; doing at once what he had to do.&nbsp; He never cavilled
about trifles.&nbsp; There was no shuffling about him&mdash;no
humbug.&nbsp; The only thing he could not tolerate was <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the
drone.&nbsp; He held strong opinions on most subjects, and he
adhered to them firmly.&nbsp; He never did anything by halves; he
went into it body and soul, with the whole of his nature; he went
straight to the point.&nbsp; When he had settled a thing he left
it as something done; when two sides of a question were presented
to him, he was quick to decide, and he was usually right in his
decision.</p>
<p>Dr. Smiles writes&mdash;&ldquo;The successful merchant is not
merely the man who is most fertile in commercial combinations,
but the man who acts upon his judgment with the greatest
promptitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Crampton, George Moore&rsquo;s
partner, says&mdash;&ldquo;I never knew him make a mistake in
judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another fact to be observed is, that it is the country lads
who, as a rule, are the most successful.&nbsp; At first they fail
in accuracy, and quickness, and promptitude.&nbsp; They are slow
compared with town-bred boys.&nbsp; &ldquo;The City boy,&rdquo;
writes Dr. Smiles, &ldquo;scarcely grows up; he is rushed up; he
lives amid a constant succession of excitements, one obliterating
another.&nbsp; It is very different with the country boy; he is
much slower in arriving at his maturity than the town boy, but he
is greater when he reaches it; he is hard and uncouth at first,
whereas the town boy is worn smooth by perpetual friction, like
the pebbles in a running stream.&nbsp; The country boy learns a
great deal, though he may seem to be unlearned; he knows a good
deal about nature, and a great deal about men.&nbsp; He has had
time to grow.&nbsp; His brainpower is held in reserve; hence the
curious fact, that, in course of time, the country-bred boy
passes the City-bred boy, and rises to the highest positions in
London life.&nbsp; Look at all the great firms, and you will find
that the greater number of the leading partners are those who
originally were country-bred boys.&nbsp; The young man bred in
the country never forgets his origin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There
is,&rdquo; says Rochefoucauld, &ldquo;a country accent, not in
his speech only, but in his thought, conduct, character, and
manner of existing, which never forsakes him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Moore had a brother.&nbsp; He was far apter than
George; he had a better education; he had read extensively, and
was well versed in literature; but he wanted that which his
brother George had&mdash;intense perseverance.&nbsp; Hence the
failure of the one, and the success of the other.&nbsp; It is
thus the determined, persevering man who succeeds.&nbsp; <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>It was thus
Warren Hastings won back the broad lands of his ancestors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In New York,&rdquo; says an American writer,
&ldquo;fortunes are suddenly made, and suddenly lost.&nbsp; I can
count over a dozen merchants who, at the time I began to write
this book, a few months ago, were estimated to be worth not less
than 250,000 dollars&mdash;some of them half a million&mdash;who
are now utterly penniless.&nbsp; At the opening of this year
(1868), a merchant, well-known in this city, had a surplus of
250,000 dollars in cash.&nbsp; He died suddenly in July.&nbsp; He
made his will about three months before his death, and appointed
his executors.&nbsp; By that will he divided 250,000
dollars.&nbsp; His executors contributed 1,000 dollars to save a
portion of his furniture for his widow, and that was all that was
left her out of that great estate.&nbsp; He did what thousands
have done before him&mdash;what thousands are doing now, and will
do to-morrow.&nbsp; He had money enough; but he wanted a little
more.&nbsp; He was induced to go into a nice little speculation
in Wall Street; he put in 50,000 dollars.&nbsp; To save it he put
in 50,000 dollars more.&nbsp; The old story was repeated, with
the same result.&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew a gentleman who began the
world as an advertising agent; he managed to get a share in a
newspaper, which eventually became an immense commercial
success.&nbsp; His share of the profits amounted to some
thousands a-year; but this was not enough&mdash;he must have
more.&nbsp; He turned money-lender, borrowing at 5 per cent., to
lend money on bad security at a high rate of interest.&nbsp; He
died in the prime of life, a bankrupt, and of a broken heart.</p>
<p>It is not every one who knows when to leave off money-making;
but there is a time when a wise man will remain satisfied with
what he has won.&nbsp; I knew a gentleman in the Corn Exchange,
who was worth &pound;80,000.&nbsp; That was not enough for him,
though to many it would have been a fair fortune.&nbsp; He was
determined to make one grand <i>coup</i> before finally retiring
from business, and enjoying the fruits of his industry and
enterprise.&nbsp; He did so against the entreaties of his
friends.&nbsp; The grand coup was a failure, and he died as poor
as Job.&nbsp; Such men are to be met in London every day.</p>
<p>A man who died very rich, was very poor when he was a
boy.&nbsp; When asked how he got his riches, he
replied&mdash;&ldquo;My father taught me never to play till all
my work for the day <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>was finished, and never to spend
money till I had earned it.&nbsp; If I had but
half-an-hour&rsquo;s work to do in a day, I must do that the
first thing, <i>and in half-an-hour</i>.&nbsp; After this was
done I was allowed to play.&nbsp; I early formed the habit of
doing everything in its time, and it soon became perfectly easy
to do so.&nbsp; It is to this habit that I owe my
prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Titus Salt, the millionaire, who made a fortune by the
introduction of alpaca-wool-cloth into the country, was a very
early riser.&nbsp; At Bradford, where he first commenced
business, before he had built his grand manufactory at Saltaire,
it used to be said&mdash;&ldquo;There is Titus Salt; he has made
a thousand pounds before other men were out of bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was industry that helped to make Franklin a successful man
of business.&nbsp; This industry was, he tells us, a source of
credit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Particularly I was told, that mention being
made of the new printing-office at the Merchants&rsquo;
Every-Night Club, the general opinion was that it must fail,
there being already two printers in the place&mdash;Kermer and
Bradford.&nbsp; But Dr. Baird gave a contrary opinion: &lsquo;for
the industry of that Franklin,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is superior
to anything I ever saw of the kind.&nbsp; I see him still at work
when I go from the club, and he is at work again before the
neighbours are out of bed.&nbsp; This struck the rest, and he
soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with
stationery; but as yet he did not choose to engage in shop
business.&rsquo;&nbsp; I mention this,&rdquo; adds Franklin,
&ldquo;more particularly, and the more emphatically, though it
seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of my posterity
who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue (industry)
when they see its effects in my favour throughout this
relation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, let us see how men lose money; for the art of keeping
money is of greater importance to a man than that of making
it.&nbsp; The great house of Overend and Gurney fell, and threw
all London into a panic, because the house did not know how to
keep money, but went into all sorts of ruinous speculations,
which ultimately brought it to the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;In a
little room in one of the by-streets of New York, up a narrow,
dingy flight of stairs, may be seen a man,&rdquo; says an
American writer, &ldquo;doing a little brokerage which his
friends put into his hands.&nbsp; That man at one time inherited
the name and fortune of a house which America <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>delighted
to honour.&nbsp; That house was founded by two lads who left
their homes to seek their fortunes in a great city.&nbsp; They
owned nothing but the clothes they wore, and a small bundle tied
to a stick, and thrown over their shoulders.&nbsp; Their clothes
were home-spun, were woven under the parental roof, and cut and
made by motherly skill and sisterly affection.&nbsp; They carried
with them the rich boon of a mother&rsquo;s blessing and a
mother&rsquo;s prayers.&nbsp; They were honest, industrious,
truthful, and temperate.&nbsp; They did anything they found to do
that was honest.&nbsp; They began a little trade, which increased
in their hands, and extended till it reached all portions of the
civilised world.&nbsp; They identified themselves with every good
work.&nbsp; Education, humanity, and religion blessed their
munificence.&nbsp; The founders of the house died, leaving a
colossal fortune, and a name without a stain.&nbsp; They left
their business and their reputation to the man who occupies the
little chamber that we have referred to.&nbsp; He abandoned the
principles on which the fame and honour of the house had been
built up.&nbsp; He stained the name that for fifty years had been
untarnished.&nbsp; He fled from his home; he wandered about the
country under an assumed name.&nbsp; Widows and orphans who had
left trust-money in their hands, lost their all.&nbsp; In his
fall he dragged down the innocent, and spread consternation on
all sides.&nbsp; A few years passed, and after skulking about in
various cities abroad, he ventured back.&nbsp; Men were too kind
to harm him.&nbsp; Those whom he had befriended in the days of
his prosperity, helped him to a little brokerage to earn his
bread, and so he lingered on, and died, poor and forgotten, and
obscure;&mdash;a warning to the prosperous, not to forget that
honesty is the best policy after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fast man in business, sooner or later, comes to grief.&nbsp;
A young man in New York represented a New England house of great
wealth and high standing.&nbsp; He was considered one of the
smartest and most promising young men in the city.&nbsp; The
balance in the bank, kept by the house, was very large, and the
young man used to boast that he could draw his cheque any day for
200,000 dollars, and have it honoured.&nbsp; The New England
house used a great deal of paper, and it could command the names
of the best capitalists to any extent.&nbsp; He was accustomed to
sign notes in blank and leave them with the concern, so much
confidence had he <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>in its soundness and integrity.&nbsp; Yet, strange to
say, these notes, with those of other wealthy men, with nearly
the whole financial business of the house, were in the hands of
the young manager in New York.&nbsp; In the meanwhile he took a
turn at Harry Hill&rsquo;s to relieve the pressure of
business.&nbsp; Low amusements, and the respectable company he
found, suited him.&nbsp; From a spectator he became a
dancer.&nbsp; From dancing he took to drinking.&nbsp; He then
tried his hand at play, and was cleaned out every night, drinking
deeply all the while.&nbsp; He became enamoured of a certain
class of women, clothed them in silk, velvets, and jewels, drove
them in dashing teams in the Central Park, secured them fine
mansions, and paid the expenses of their costly establishments,
all the while keeping the confidence of his business
associates.&nbsp; In his jaded, wan, and dissipated look, men saw
his attention to business.&nbsp; The New England manager of the
house was the father of the young man.&nbsp; His reputation was
without a stain, and confidence in his integrity was
unlimited.&nbsp; In the midst of his business he dropped down
dead.&nbsp; This brought things to a crisis, and an exposure
immediately followed.&nbsp; The great house was bankrupt, and
everybody ruined that had anything to do with it.&nbsp; Those who
supposed themselves well off, found themselves quite the
reverse.&nbsp; Widows and orphans lost their all.&nbsp; Men
suspended business on the right hand and the left.&nbsp; In
gambling, drinking, and dissipation, this young fellow had
squandered the enormous sum of 1,400,000 dollars.&nbsp; It is an
old familiar moral to be learnt from the story of that
man&rsquo;s decline and fall.</p>
<p>But to return to money-making.&nbsp; &ldquo;I find,&rdquo;
said a shrewd merchant, &ldquo;I make most money when I am least
anxious about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distinguished American, James Halford, rose, step by step,
up the ladder of fortune till he reached the top.&nbsp; Some
twenty years before he had stood at the bottom, and it was
curious to hear what the world said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all luck,&rdquo; cried one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing
but luck.&nbsp; Why, sir, I have managed at times to get up a
step or two, but have always fallen down ere long; and now I have
given up striving, for luck is against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;it is not so much
luck as scheming; the selfish schemer goes up, while more honest
folk remain at the foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;Patronage does it all,&rdquo; said a
third.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must have somebody to take you by the
hand, and help you up, or you have no chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James Halford heard all these varied opinions of the world,
but still persisted in looking upwards, for he had faith in
himself.&nbsp; He rose from the lowest situation in a store till
he became a trader for himself, and amassed a large fortune.</p>
<p>Mr. Freedley&rsquo;s unvarying motto
was&mdash;&ldquo;Self-reliance and self-dependence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He said&mdash;&ldquo;My observations through life satisfy me,
that at least nine-tenths of those most successful in business
start in life without any reliance except upon their own heads
and hands&mdash;<i>hoe their own</i> row from the
jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas Longworth, the Cincinnati millionaire,
says&mdash;&ldquo;I have always had these two things before
me:&mdash;Do what you undertake thoroughly.&nbsp; Be faithful in
all accepted trusts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephen Gerard&rsquo;s motto was the well-worn
one&mdash;&ldquo;Take care of the cents, the dollars will take
care of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart, the merchant prince of New York,
said&mdash;&ldquo;No abilities, however splendid, can command
success without intense labour and persevering
application.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Ricardo had his three golden rules when on the Stock
Exchange.&nbsp; They were&mdash;&ldquo;Never refuse an option
when you can get it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cut short your
losses.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let your profits run on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man who had, by his own unaided exertions, become rich, was
asked by his friend the secret of success.&nbsp; His reply
was&mdash;&ldquo;I accumulated about half my property by
attending to my own business, and the other half by letting other
people&rsquo;s entirely alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the great Wedgewood, there was another&mdash;an
eleventh commandment; and it was&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt not be
idle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us string together, in this collection, a few of Poor
Richard&rsquo;s maxims&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I never saw an oft-removed tree,<br />
Nor yet an oft-removed family,<br />
That throve as well as those that settled be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, he wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that by the plough would thrive,<br />
Himself must either hold or drive.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Here
is another&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many estates are spent in the getting,<br
/>
Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,<br />
And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One must be recorded here for the benefit of the reader who
would achieve commercial success&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Women and wine, game and deceit,<br />
Make the wealth small and the want great.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Poor Richard writes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fond pride of dress is sure a curse;<br />
Ere fancy you consult&mdash;consult your purse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A truthful warning is contained in the following
lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vessels large may venture more,<br />
But little boats should keep near shore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All should remember&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For age and want save what you may,<br />
No morning sun lasts a whole day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this other&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Get what you can, and what you get hold,<br
/>
&rsquo;Tis the stone that will turn all your lead to
gold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One equally well worth remembering as any of Poor
Richard&rsquo;s, is&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A penny saved is twopence clear,<br />
A pin a day is a groat a year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Franklin, in a letter, finished by saying&mdash;&ldquo;In
short, the way to wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the
market.&nbsp; It depends chiefly on two words&mdash;industry and
frugality; that is, waste neither time nor money, but make the
best use of both.&nbsp; Without industry and frugality nothing
will do, and with them everything.&nbsp; He that gets all he can
honestly, and saves all he gets, necessary expenses excepted,
will certainly become rich, if that Being who governs the world,
to whom all should look for a blessing on their honest
endeavours, doth not, in His wise providence, determine
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, in a time of scarcity, as an infallible receipt for
filling empty purses, Franklin wrote&mdash;&ldquo;First, let
honesty and <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>industry be thy constant companions; and, secondly,
spend one penny less than thy clear gains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samuel Budgett, well-known as the successful merchant, when
about ten years of age, began, at Coleford, to lay the foundation
of his fame and fortune.&nbsp; He thus describes how he first got
money&mdash;&ldquo;I went,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the mills of
Kilmersdon to school, a distance of three miles.&nbsp; One day,
on my way, I picked up a horse-shoe, and carried it about three
miles, and sold it to a blacksmith for a penny; that was the
first penny I ever recollect possessing, and I kept it for some
time.&nbsp; A few weeks after, the same man called my attention
to a boy who was carrying off some dirt opposite his door, and
offered, if I would beat the boy by doing it quicker, he being a
bigger boy than myself, to give me a penny.&nbsp; I did so; he
made a mark upon it, and promised me that if I would bring it to
him that day fortnight he would give me another.&nbsp; I took it
to him at the appointed time, when he fulfilled his promise, and
I thus became possessed of threepence; since then I have never
been without, except when I gave it all away.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;One,&rdquo; writes his admiring biographer, the Rev. W.
Budgett, &ldquo;would not have imagined, in seeing the little
schoolboy stop and look at the old horse-shoe, that the
turning-point of his life had come; but so it was; he converts
that horse-shoe into his first penny, and never more wants a
penny.&nbsp; Those men whom we see often without a penny, have
all of them passed by the horse-shoe in their path when they were
boys; and those other men who, from nothing, are rising rapidly,
have all had the sense to pick up the horse-shoe, and turn it
into the foundation of a fortune.&nbsp; Paths vary; but every
boy, if his eyes are open, will certainly find the horse-shoe in
his path at one point or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again we fall back on Franklin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;that money is of a prolific generating
nature.&nbsp; Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget
more, and so on.&nbsp; Five shillings turned is six; turned again
it is seven-and-threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred
pounds.&nbsp; The more there is of it, the more it produces every
turning, so that the profits rise quicker.&nbsp; He that kills a
breeding sow, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth
generation.&nbsp; He that murders a crown, destroys all that it
might have produced, even scores of pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Our
last words must be of advice to young persons upon entering the
world.</p>
<p>Select the kind of business that suits your natural
inclinations and temperament.</p>
<p>A business man must keep at the hold, and steer his own
ship.</p>
<p>Do not take too much advice.</p>
<p>If you prosper in business, do not make too much show.</p>
<p>Work on positive facts.&nbsp; Do not let hope predominate too
much.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be visionary.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put too much reliance on friends in business.</p>
<p>Never accept a bill for a friend.&nbsp; You stand a chance of
losing money and friend.</p>
<p>Speak very little in business.&nbsp; Pump others rather than
be pumped yourself.</p>
<p>Consult wisely, and resolve firmly.</p>
<p>Hesitation in business is bad; resolution, after proper
consideration, is omnipotent and healthy.</p>
<p>Time, money, and judgment are three essential things for a
speculation.</p>
<p>Go with the tide.</p>
<p>Consider everybody sharper than yourself in order to be
yourself on your guard.&nbsp; Take the meaning of people, not
their words, as a guide in business.&nbsp; Seek an interview
rather than communication by letter, and observe the
person&rsquo;s expression by his eyes.</p>
<p>Keep your books posted up systematically.</p>
<p>Beware of little expenses.&nbsp; A small leak will sink the
ship.</p>
<p>Make the best of a bad bargain.</p>
<p>A policy of life assurance is the cheapest and safest mode of
making provision for a man&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Finally, as Matthew Henry wrote&mdash;&ldquo;Hope the best,
get ready for the worst, and then take what God sends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spendthrift, who had nearly wasted all his patrimony, seeing
an acquaintance in a coat not of the newest cut, told him he
thought it had been his great-grandfather&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;and I have
also my great-grandfather&rsquo;s land, which is more than you
can say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gentleman, whose place of business was not a thousand miles
from the Exchange, was annoyed, as many business men are, by
impecunious individuals desiring small loans.&nbsp; He <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>adopted the
following method of dealing with them.&nbsp; He would listen
amicably to the long preface to the request to &ldquo;Just lend
me a sovereign for a few days,&rdquo; and answer,
&ldquo;Certainly;&rdquo; and then, turning to a clerk, say:
&ldquo;James, we have a sovereign to lend, have we
not?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; says the well-trained
James.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, lend it to Mr. Beat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not in, sir; you loaned it to Mr. Bummer the day
before yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, yes; so I did.&nbsp;
Well, when it comes in lend it to Mr. Beat;&rdquo; and bowing to
the borrower, the merchant resumes his business, and the needy
one walks dejectedly out to try a more profitable place.</p>
<p>A man who would thrive should get married.&nbsp; A good wife
is a true helpmeet in fighting the battle of life.&nbsp; This is
the hidden gem &ldquo;of purest ray serene.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr.
Crosby says&mdash;&ldquo;The true girl is to be sought for.&nbsp;
She does not parade herself as show goods.&nbsp; She is not
fashionable generally; she is not rich.&nbsp; But, oh! what a
heart she has when you have found her!&nbsp; So large, and pure,
and womanly!&nbsp; When you see <i>her</i> you wonder if those
showy things outside were really women.&nbsp; If you gain
<i>her</i> love, your two thousand are a million.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll wear simple dresses, and turn them when
necessary.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll keep everything neat and tidy in
your sky parlour, and give you such a welcome when you come home,
that you&rsquo;ll think your parlour higher than ever.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll entertain true friends on a dollar, and astonish you
with the thought how very little happiness depends on
money.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll make you love home (if you are not a
brute), and teach you how to pity while you scorn a poor
fashionable society that thinks itself rich, and <i>vainly tries
to think itself happy</i>.&nbsp; Now do not, I pray you, say any
more, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to marry.&rsquo;&nbsp; Go, find
the true woman, and you can!&nbsp; Throw away that cigar; and
avoid intoxicating drinks, the <span
class="GutSmall">GRAVE</span> of home comforts; be sensible
yourself, and seek your wife in a sensible way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look carefully to your expenditures.&nbsp; No matter what
comes in, if more goes out, you will always be poor.&nbsp; The
art is not in making money, but in keeping it; little expenses,
like mice in a barn, when they are many, make great waste.&nbsp;
Hair by hair heads get bald; straw by straw the thatch goes off
the cottage; and drop by drop the rain comes in the
chamber.&nbsp; A barrel is soon empty if the tap leaks but a drop
a minute.&nbsp; When you mean to save, begin with your <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>mouth; many
thieves pass down the red lane.&nbsp; The ale-jug is a great
waste.&nbsp; In all other things keep within compass.&nbsp; Never
stretch your legs farther than the blankets will reach, or you
will soon take cold.&nbsp; In clothes, choose suitable and
lasting stuff, and not tawdry fineries.&nbsp; To be warm is the
main thing; never mind looks.&nbsp; A fool may make money, but it
needs a wise man to spend it.&nbsp; Remember, it is easier to
build two chimneys than to keep one going.&nbsp; If you give all
to back and board, there is nothing left for the
savings-bank.&nbsp; Fare hard and work hard when you are young,
and you will have a chance to rest when you are old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A successful business man told me there were two things
which he learned when he was eighteen, which were ever afterwards
of great use to him&mdash;namely, &lsquo;Never to lose anything,
and never to forget anything.&rsquo;&nbsp; An old lawyer sent him
with an important paper, with certain instructions what to do
with it.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; inquired the young man,
&lsquo;suppose I lose it; what shall I do then?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You must not lose it!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
mean to,&rsquo; said the young man; &lsquo;but suppose I should
happen to?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But I say you <i>must not</i>
happen to; I shall make no provision for any such occurrence; you
must not lose it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This put a new train of thought into the young
man&rsquo;s mind, and he found that if he was determined to do a
thing, he could do it.&nbsp; He made such a provision against
every contingency, that he never lost anything.&nbsp; He found
this equally true about forgetting.&nbsp; If a certain matter of
importance was to be remembered, he pinned it down on his mind,
fastened it there, and made it stay.&nbsp; He used to
say&mdash;&lsquo;When a man tells me that he forgot to do
something, I tell him he might as well have said, &lsquo;I do not
care enough about your business to take the trouble to think of
it again.&rsquo;&nbsp; I once had an intelligent young man in my
employment who deemed it sufficient excuse for neglecting any
important task to say, &lsquo;I forgot it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I told
him that would not answer.&nbsp; If he was sufficiently
interested, he would be careful to remember.&nbsp; It was because
he did not care enough that he forgot it.&nbsp; I drilled him
with this truth.&nbsp; He worked for me three years, and during
the last of the three he was entirely changed in tins
respect.&nbsp; He did not forget a thing.&nbsp; His forgetting,
he found, was a lazy and careless habit of the mind, which he
cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>While
we write, the great orator of the age has lectured the people of
Hawarden in particular, and of England in general, on the virtues
of thrift.&nbsp; The subject is worthy of his genius.&nbsp;
Thrift lies at the foundation of all individual or national
greatness.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> notes that Mr. Gladstone only
harps on an old string when he says that Englishmen are lacking
in thrift.&nbsp; The failing is commonly admitted, and it is by
no means confined to a single class.&nbsp; It pervades the whole
community.&nbsp; We may be more industrious than our neighbours,
but we certainly are more extravagant.&nbsp; We earn strenuously,
but it is in order that we may spend freely.&nbsp; In our choice
of food and its preparation, in our dwellings, in our comforts
and luxuries, and in our recreations, we are lavish as compared
with other nations.&nbsp; There is probably no single class in
this country which does not, as a rule, live nearer to the margin
of its income than the corresponding class in France.&nbsp; The
French peasant is almost the slave of his land and his family,
and labours unceasingly for the one while he saves ungrudgingly
for the other.&nbsp; Our own labourers work as hard no doubt, and
probably harder, but they are much more extravagant in their
habits.&nbsp; Their food is far more solid and expensive, and it
is dressed with far less thrift and skill.&nbsp; The case is not
very different with the classes higher in the social scale.&nbsp;
Their industry and perseverance are unrivalled, but these virtues
are too often made to do duty for prudence and economy as
well.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone is, no doubt, light in attributing to
friendly societies an influence which tends in some degree to
counteract the evil consequences of individual prodigality.&nbsp;
They do not directly encourage a more frugal mode of life among
the masses, but they develop a social feeling of common welfare
which at least counteracts individual selfishness.&nbsp; Thus,
independently of their purely economical advantages, they are by
no means despicable instruments of political and social
education.&nbsp; But, after all, it is on the individual himself
that it depends whether he shall be thrifty, and get on in the
world, or shall be careless, and indolent, and extravagant, and
finally sink down to the bottom, a burden to the rest of the
community.&nbsp; &ldquo;The way to wealth,&rdquo; says an old
writer, &ldquo;is as plain as the way to market.&nbsp; It depends
chiefly on two plain words&mdash;industry and frugality; that is,
waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>As we
go to press, we find a meeting held at the Mansion House, London
(the Earl of Shaftesbury in the chair), to hear Miss Emily
Faithfull lecture against the extravagance of modern life.&nbsp;
Ladies (she said) were sometimes accused of being the direct
means of wild expenditure; and what answer could be made to their
accusers?&nbsp; They had only to walk in any fashionable resort
to see a great deal of prodigal display in dress, which could be
accounted for only by the explanation that many of its wearers
were living beyond their means.&nbsp; This state of things arose
because women were ranked by what they wore, and not by what they
were.&nbsp; Men and women seemed to have lost the faculty of
enjoying inexpensive pleasures.&nbsp; The same extravagance was
to be found among high and low, master and man.&nbsp; The reason
of the outcry about bad servants was, because all those of the
present day wished to be like their betters; fine-ladyism had
descended from the drawing-room to the kitchen.&nbsp; Of the
various causes of this, one was the love of money, more deeply
rooted in the minds of the people of England than in those of any
other nation in the world.&nbsp; Another was the modern fusion of
classes&mdash;people finding themselves in a position in which
they were compelled, by the tyranny of custom, to &ldquo;make an
appearance&rdquo; beyond their legitimate means.&nbsp; One of the
most crying evils of these times was the credit system, and its
twin-brother debt, well described as the curse of the middle
classes, and which, like drink, was carried on in a blind,
stupid, reckless fashion.&nbsp; The meaning of the word
&ldquo;economy&rdquo; was continually being falsely made to imply
the saving of money, whereas it only meant the best possible
administration of time, labour, and money.&mdash;Mr. Thomas
Hughes, Q.C., said that the great dangers for this country were
unthrift and intemperance; and unless we could make it sober and
thrifty it would soon become insolvent.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
